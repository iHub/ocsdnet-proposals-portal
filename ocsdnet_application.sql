In this regard, he has utilized life-histories to study (i) how Argentinean political scientists use foreign knowledge to structure their scholarly careers in a peripheral region, and (ii) the reception of Niklas Luhmann''s systems theory in the Hispanic Americas. In order to analyze qualitative information, he has been using Atlas.TI for eight years, software that allows for creating conceptual networks that can sustain thick interpretations of texts (interviews, theoretical literature, etc.). Because of his postgraduate education in philosophy of technology, he has also developed  an interest in the materiality of the epistemic processes that he studies. As a consequence, in his analyses he does not take objects as mere intermediaries or infrastructure, but rather as mediators in networks that articulates also people and institutions.', 'Rodriguez Medina, L.

The findings will also be conveyed to the implementing agencies in Pakistan for developing the mitigation strategies for arsenic affected communities, management of agricultural and irrigation practices, changes in dietary patterns and management of arsenic affected individuals at multiple levels of exposure in Pakistan. \n\nAt an organizational level, capacity of PCRWR will be enhanced through the availability of expertise to conduct environmental risk assessments using predictive modeling approach.', 'Probabilistic Assessment of Geogenic Arsenic Exposure and Attributable Health Risks in Pakistan', 'Pakistan', 'Soluble  inorganic  arsenic  is  acutely  toxic  as  the  ingestion  of  large  doses  leads  to gastrointestinal symptoms, disturbances of cardiovascular and nervous system functions, and eventually death. Long-term arsenic exposure through drinking-water can increase risks of cancer in the skin, lungs, bladder and kidney, as well as other skin changes such as hyperkeratosis and pigmentation changes. In South and East Asia, an estimated 60 million  people  are  at  risk  due  to  excessively  contaminated  groundwater  sources  by arsenic as the current data showed that at least 700,000 people in the region have so far been affected  by  arsenicosis.  Pakistan is also discovered with problem of excessive groundwater arsenic in various districts of Sindh and Punjab. To develop the arsenic mitigation strategies for Pakistan, there is  a  dire  need  to  undertake  risk  assessment  based  on  multiple  levels  of anthropogenic and natural occurring arsenic in ground water, food chain and biomarkers. Thus, in this study to be undertaken at Water@Leeds, University of Leeds, UK, Ms. Hifza Rasheed (Deputy Director, PCRWR) will use the probabilistic risk assessment approach to determine the geogenic arsenic attributable health risks in Pakistan. \nThe risk assessment of arsenic  contaminated groundwater will be conducted by establishing the dose-response  relationships  in  terms  of  arsenic  exposure  routes  and  possible  health implications. Pakistan provides an environment where a variety of diets and water supplies enable a group with a variety of different types and different magnitudes of arsenic exposure to be studied.', 'The overall  goal  of  the  proposed  study  is  to  use  advance  research  tools  including biomarkers examination and predictive modeling in order to assess attributes of arsenic towards development of  various types of cancers.

He has carried out several researches in water and environment to which mining operations discharge effluents. The other skills that will enable the project to be supported are:  \n\nChemical engineering and measuring skills to measure levels of gaseous effluent constituents from the mines in order to establish levels of impacts on the communities and workers, measure levels of liquid effluent constituents from the mines in order to establish levels of impacts on water and environment; Environmental and water assessment, statistical and analytical skills to determine social, economic, environmental, health responses to mining processes in order to assess levels of impacts on the communities, fauna and flora and water, collect data on Gross Domestic Product (GDP), exports and imports, direct and indirect taxes to which the national budgets respond so as to determine the impact of mining activities on the national economy; Design, planning, managerial and developmental skills to evaluate population, number of roads, housing, shopping centres and markets, clinics or hospitals in order to determine migration, settlements and development levels due to mining operations; Assess land use issues that can bring about a mixed response from the settlers as a result of the displacement and resettlement of the populations in and around the vicinity of the mine; Work study and conflict resolution skills to determine causes of conflicts over land, polluted air, water and employment in order to find ways of mitigation and the impact of current policy directions; Analytical skills to analyze policy directions for mining, health, environment, social and development in order to find areas of improvement; Writing skills in order to write reports and other publications, conflict resolution skills in order to resolve conflicts during the project if there will be any, mathematical skills to model the impact lines.\n\nThe past research experience that will support the project include: \n\nA project funded by Association of Canadian Colleges Program (ACCCP) and CIDA that dealt with environmental health issues that dealt with diseases burden of children in Zambia’s Copperbelt province and Lusaka;  A project funded by WARFSA (SIDA) that dealt with awareness s of water sector issues and willingness to pay that involved dispute resolution; A project funded by the Copperbelt University that dealt with pollution loads and water evaluation of the Kafue River in which effluents are discharged by the mines; A project funded by the Zambia Institute of Technology that dealt with air pollution evaluation of a branch of Mopani mine in Mufulira District of the Copperbelt Province of Zambia. \n\nThe skills of other researchers that complement those of Researcher 1 above are environmental, water, air pollution and analytical skills to analyze air and water samples, writing, advisory, collaborative, analytical skills to help discuss impacts during the study.', 'Mining and Health:  An Open Evaluation of Social Economic Health Impacts of Engineering Activities for Policy Direction in Zambia', 'Zambia', 'This study is about the impact of copper extractive-mining operations on the social, economic and development of the community on one hand and health of environment, water and the communities on the other.  The copper-extractive mining in Zambia release toxic gaseous and liquid effluents that contain toxic substances that have generated out cries from the communities that live near the mines.  Particulate matter in the atmosphere and liquid effluents that go into rivers has also been a grave concern whenever full mining operations have been executed. Studies have established that extractive mining releases a lot of particulate matter into the rivers and streams and the atmosphere in Zambia. Out cry from residents of existing mines has always been on gaseous emissions and particulate matter that engulfs the living areas during dry spells of rain in Zambia.  This has been a challenge to the community for a long time.   Such complaints have been on the choking effects of gaseous and particulate emissions on the community dwellers.  If the people outside the mine can complain what level of effect would emissions have on employees who are exposed on a daily basis?  On the other hand policy directions may negatively affect social economic development of th area due to displacement of owners of the are, migration and influx of people from elsewhere that create pressure on social services, health, education and development.  Employment challenges may creep in to compound the situation.  Some policy directions from the government allow certain amounts of emissions to be released based on pollute and pay principle at the detriment of the community.  It is important therefore to revisit such policy directions as outcomes of the study.  Even though process and policy change could be expensive, the long term effects could benefit the community as a solution to the social economic, health and development challenges of Zambia.  The questions to be asked and answered during the study are based on the development challenges highlighted above and are as follows:\n\nWhat is the impact of mining activities on health, environment and water?\nWhat is the impact of mining activities on social economic development in Zambia?\nHow is mine development impacting on land, population and settlements in Zambia?\nWhat is the impact on employment by mining activities?\nHow does policy direction impact the mines and communities in Zambia\n\nThe impacts of an activity can be short term or long term or can bring about negative or positive impacts.  Emissions of toxic substances often bring about negative impacts on the environment, water and health of the communities.  It is therefore the intention of this study to examine negative impacts attributed to such emissions by examining the soils, flora and fauna in the environment and aquatic life and the loading of both gaseous and particulate matter that bring about the effects of poor health and biological and biochemical oxygen demand in water.  Policy direction can also bring about negative and positive impacts on both the extractive industries and community.  Here we are also dealing with short term and long term directions but in particular the study will look at the impact of existing policies and how they foster and harness the industry operations for the benefit of the community.  It is important also to look at the disease burden, population dynamics and the social implications that arise as a result of the existence of the mines and their extractive operations.\n\nThe rationale of the study is to obtain the major impacts and levels of emissions and policy directions that are putting pressure on the community and environment. The significance of the study is that where people have complained in some old copper extracting mines and relatively at a low level in newly developed ones because they do not want to scare the investors away while keeping quiet where the problem exists, it will unveil the issues to them in a diplomatic manner.  This study will also openly take issues to stakeholders so that they can understand the approaches that will be undertaken in resolving some of the burning issues of emissions, employment, health and development challenges of the areas where the mines exists.  It will also address the policy directions with the companies and government, various impacts that will help companies resolve their operational challenges in order to be in tune with the human resource that is living near their mines.', 'Five links will be studied in the evaluation and monitoring of impacts at each mine during the study.  The extractive industry is at the centre of all the links that include water, environment, land use, health, and social economic development.  Statistical analysis will be carried out on each link for each industry or a combination of links across mines.\n\nThe sampling of gaseous and liquid effluents from the mines every month for 15 months and analyzing on the spot or taking some to the laboratory where necessary in order to determine levels of agents that create negative impacts on the communities will be by using special gas or liquid samplers. \n\nRandom and purposive sampling of the communities to administer questionnaires for impact determination of effluents from the mines will be carried out twice during the study period at the beginning of the project and after six to seven months using questionnaires.\n\nData on development, social and economic impacts will be collected by counting the number of social amenities, sports amenities, lodges, clinics, hospitals, bars and data from various stake holders dealing with imports and exports and Gross Domestic Products and questionnaires for collecting information on migrations and economic status of the individual members in the communities.  \n\nThe information on employment levels will also be collected using the seminars or meetings and questionnaires and by direct discussions with management in order to evaluate the impacts on the community. \n\nThe measurements of flow rate of effluents, particularly water from process areas and gas from chimneys, from the mines and levels of constituents will be measured using water and gas analysis kits.  The analysis will help to determine the loading on the receiving environment of causative impact agents; sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and dioxide, sulfur and particulate matter, acidic vapours etc.\n\nMedical data on disease burden in the community will be collected using questionnaires in the community and clinics in order to find the relation between emissions from the mines and the types of diseases and hence the disease burden.\n\nThe correlations between the cause and effect will be examined in order to determine the levels of impacts in order to address the challenges of the cause-effect chain in the area of each mine and Zambia''s economy and policy directions of the mines.\n\nA total of five members of research team and an additional ten students will be participate in the implementation of the activities of the project.  The students will assist in the collection of data during the distribution and collection of questionnaires in the communities, clinics and other designated points of the projects. \n\nThe involvement of the communities, staff from the mining companies, clinics and the participation of stakeholders in market places, government institutions means that the project will exercise a high degree of openness so that the disclosure of information will help in the mitigation process at the company, government and community levels.  This will be supportive of the ideals of OCSDNet', 'The following are the expected development-related outcomes:\n\n1. Improved awareness in the communities, workers and employers about the state of their city or district as they carry out their actions on a daily basis.\n2. Documental evidence of effluent releases and their effect on the environment, water and health of workers and communities that can be used to either influence the policy directions or make process changes to engineering operations in the mines.\n3.  Developmental information that can be used for policy direction by mines, government and the community leaders.\n4. A case study from which future mine investors can learn from in the way they will implement the mine operations\n5. Implementation of process changes\n6. Reduced disease burden\n7. Improved policy directions\n\nProject is relevant as two of the mines are new and as pollution and impacts are time dependent, the project fits well because the mines have attained full operating capacities after installation of equipment and commissioning.  The other three mines are long existing but have had challenges with the communities in which they are.  The challenges of complaints due to gaseous and particulate matter.  The challenges of fauna and flora loosing their normal colour due to acid drops damaging leaves.  The challenge of particulate matter covering fauna and flora and habitat surfaces and the challenge of heavy metals released with waste-waters that get released into streams and rivers of the ares in which the mines are situated etc.The project will therefore help to quantify values of impacts and causative levels on which the policy direction will be examined in order to resolve some of the challenges.  The usefulness of the OCSDNet cannot be under emphasized.  The funding will drive the project from beginning to completion. The spirit of openness during the study will not only help to obtain meaningful data but also help to have reliable data that point to resolving the impacts, state of development in the community and environment and water.', 'The project will begin in January 2015.  The equipment to be used in the project will be procured in the first month.  The activity plan will also be developed in the first month.  The data collection activities will begin in the second month and will continue for fifteen months in order to have information on social development issues or impacts i. e. indoor and outdoor entertainment infrastructure and other aspects; Health development impacts that include disease burden, infrastructure, man power challenges and fitness centres; Economic development and impacts that involve business entities including markets that support the development of the communities and mining operations, employment levels, levels of remuneration, GDP, imports and exports; Clean water development or impacts on quality of water in streams and rivers that support the communities; Environment impacts that are responses of the environment to effluents from the mines. Four seminars will be conducted to evaluate the responses to effluents and policy direction of the mines and government.  There will also be write ups of progress reports and final report to conclude the project by December, 2016.\n\nThe meaningful success and impact of the project will be appreciated only if there will be an over- whelming support and participation from the community and mine employees and management, and policy implementers, openness in research and discussions during data collections and that funds for the project will be released on time, that there will be no disturbances to the activities of the project such as mine shutdowns, catastrophes etc., and that, most important, the results from the project are implemented to mitigate negative and improve the positive impacts of development challenges of the society.\n\nThe evaluation of data will be by correlations and statistical analysis using ANOVA and related methods on the impacts of defined mining variables; sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and dioxides, particulate matter, policy directions, heavy metals and toxic pH on the receiving environment; atmospheric environment, water, community, workers and social economic environments.', 'CAD 80 000', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/Letter_of_endorsementOCSDnet7.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/BUDGET_for_OCSDnet_ProjectPDF8.pdf', 22, NULL, 'complete', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, 'yes'),

Pisciculture value chain possess numerous advantages such as doubling the returns to investors and farmers in pisciculture enterprise, creation of jobs, delivering high quality fish products to the consumers amongst others. Despite all these aforementioned attributes of pisciculture, it faces an imminent threat in Climate change. Climate change affects not only the ground water level, but also the variability of this water bodies affects the aquatic lives that depends on it for survival which invariably threatens the one major protein source of food for mankind and food security of our nation. It is in the light of this situation, the entire world had come together since 1999 to develop policies, programmes as well as pull resources together to adjust and manage climate change issues via implementation and support of various climate adaptation and mitigation measures. The Nigerian government is not left out in this race as it recently diverted its policies towards the addition of value chain to various agricultural products produced in the country. A number of general circulation models (GCMs) are currently available to simulate future climate, each of which gives differing results, particularly at regional scales. To date, the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) 2002 scenarios have been applied most widely, and for consistency form the basis of the current analysis. It is acknowledged, however, that these scenarios tend towards drier future predictions relative to other GCMs. With this in mind, data provided by UKCIP demonstrate that under medium–high emissions there will be more hot and dry summers, with over half of the summers by the 2080s similar to the hot, dry summer of 1995. The significance of this for freshwater ecosystems is that drought conditions would be far more prevalent, particularly in south-east England. There would also be a shift to a greater proportion of wetter winters such as that experienced in 1994/1995, particularly in the north and west, although the shift is less pronounced than the projected increase in summer drought. Groundwater recharge would also be reduced and flows in groundwater-dominated rivers are projected to decrease throughout the year. The proposed research will use downscaled scenarios projected for the 2020s and 2050s to explore impacts on selected ecosystems. The main objective of the study will be to analyze the effect of climate change on water variability in pisciculture enterprise in Southwestern region of Nigeria. Therefore, the specific objectives will be to: (i) describe the socioeconomic characteristics of pisciculture farmers in these regions; (ii) evaluate the influence of their socioeconomic characteristics on their adaptation measures; (iii) evaluate the level of awareness of the effect of climate change on water variability in pisciculture enterprise; (iv) estimate the effect of climate change on water variability as regards productivity; (v) identify various adaptation measures known and available to these farmers; (vi) estimate the cost incurred during the process of acquiring these adaptation techniques; and (vii) identify various constraints encountered by fish farmers due to climate change issues.', 'Study area\nThe study area for this study is Southwestern region of Nigeria which comprises of five (5) states which are Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, Ondo and Akure respectively. \nSampling Size and Procedures\nFor the purpose of this study, in order to understand the interaction of water variability on pisciculture enterprise, how fish farmers are adapting and whether adaptation measures are enough to avoid adverse climate-change impacts a multi-stage sampling research study will be carried out in this area. The procedure for selection will include firstly, a selection of all five (5) Southwestern states in Nigeria, which will include Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, Ondo and Akure respectively. Secondly, a random selection of ten (10) Local Government Areas from each state and thirdly, a randomized selection of ten (10) communities in these respective regions. Finally, five (5) pisciculturist/fish farmers will be randomly selected in these regions. A total of 2500 pisciculturist will be sampled by administering questionnaires and focus group discussions. The Southwestern region of Nigeria the most common livelihoods are in agriculture, fishing, pisciculture, etc. with a population of approximately 25million people (NPC, 2006) and over coastal land of over 10,345 sq km/1292 sq m (Encarta, 2009). \nData Analysis\nObjective I will be determined using various descriptive statistical tools such as mean, frequency, charts and so on.

(Palgrave).\nHe is currently a faculty member of the Interdisciplinary Studies Committee on Violence, Subjectivity and Culture and the Program for Critical Studies of Political Transitions (PECT), at Universidad de los Andes.', 'Regarding the pain of others: Repertoires, daily practices and inter-subjectivities in the psychosocial work with victims of political violence in Colombia', 'Colombia', 'In the past three years, the Colombian government has begun to promote the implementation of an institutional gear aimed at fostering post-conflict scenario. Some of these efforts have materialized in programs, laws and policies focused on reparation for victims of armed conflict. In particular, the official psychosocial intervention programs for victims of the armed conflict in Colombia have been conglomerate near the Unit for the Attention and Reparation for Victims (UARIV) and the Program for Integral Health and Psychosocial Care of Victims of Conflict - PAPSIVI within the framework of Law 1448 of 2011. \nThe work experience of the UARIV and the beginning of PAPSIVI, have revealed various challenges which face these state programs. \nOne of the most significant challenges is associated with the lack of professional training in psychology to respond effectively to the demands of psychosocial work in situations of armed conflict. In the same sense, the lack of tools focused on the specific demands of the context of war and political violence of the Colombian conflict and the trend towards the application of generic tools of psychology (decontextualized or employees on the basis of their proven useful in countries that have had experiences of civilians, ethnic wars or dictatorships). \nIn the first case, it is found that there are no curricula tailored to the needs of the context in psychology programs Colombian universities, while in the second, it is evident the overcrowding of tools, like a results from trans-nationalization of transitional scenarios.  \nThis research seeks to develop an analysis about the political violence in Colombia, from the inquiry by the practices of psychosocial work performed over the last 20 years in the country. The research aims to deepen the experience of the professionals who have developed psychosocial work with victims of political violence, and seeks to understand their strategies, narratives and forms of action, contained in everyday practices. By focusing on the everyday, the investigation will delve into the ways in which these professionals are located in relation to the context of psychosocial work, recognizing both the subject involved in this work, and the ways in which they have woven inter-subjective relations between victims and the professionals.  \nIt aims to go beyond the characterization methodologies, tools and psychosocial framework to recognize in their approaches, the subjects involved in its implementation. In that sense, the research wants to descent from the place of institutional repertoires and institutional discourses to the place of the subjectivity that daily, constructs and deconstructs these discourses and repertories.\nThe research deepens into the recognition and understanding of the professionals who develop psychosocial work, since in them has focused largely the task of accompanying the effects and impacts of armed conflict on the mental health and social bond in recent years. And because in Colombia, although various strategies have been implemented in the psychosocial work aimed at victims of political violence, this diversity has not been analyzed. Moreover, the choice of these professionals, involves the question of the ethical and political implications that comes from being at the pain of others and the ways in which the relationship with this deed or pain is managed in listening to the professional. \nThe research will be made an acknowledgment of the institutions and organizations (NGO) that have made psychosocial work with victims of political violence in Colombia, to identify significant approaches, methodologies and tools. But, at the same time, to recognize how this knowledge about the "psychosocial" has been constructed by the inter-connections between the victims (families, communities, etc.) and these professionals that are disposed to listen.  \nThis is a look at the micro-politics of intersubjective relations, in order to understand the challenges of public policy for psychosocial support to victims of armed conflict and to think of ways to generate an ethics of listening when you are at the pain of others.', 'Will be considered four scenarios of the psychosocial work in the context of war and political violence in Colombia, for four victimizing events, namely: i) torture ii) forced disappearance of persons; iii) forced displacement; iv) kidnapping.\nFirst will be performed a mapping of organizations and institutions that make or have been conducted psychosocial work around these victimizing events.\nBased on this mapping a timeline recognizing the institutional actors involved in the past 20 years and their geographical areas of intervention will take place. Likewise, we will make a bibliographic balance of the productions by these institutions and organizations, recognizing trends in approaches and methodologies.\nSecondly and, based on the initial mapping, some professionals that have developed psychosocial work (intervention, support or care) will be interviewed. We will use a semi-structured and, in some cases, focus groups discussions. \nAdditionally, we will make collaborative dialogues will be conducted annually, with professionals and organizations through talks, to discuss major trends around psychosocial work in contexts of political violence in Colombia. \nThe research requires visits to different regions, in order to systematize the experiences in different areas. We expected to work with NGO, state institutions and organizations of victims. Exchanges with professionals from Argentina, Chile, Spain and South Africa will also be conducted, to recognize the inter-change around the “psychosocial” in a South-South perspective.  \nRegarding the individual interviews and focus groups, a documentation process is done through the audio or video recording. For their part, regular meetings and talks will be organized following a specific theme for each year.', 'Generating New Knowledge: \n- A book published at the end of the research: "An ethics of listening: psychosocial work in Colombia". \n\nSocial Appropriation of Knowledge: \n- Two annual meetings of collaborative dialogue with guests from organizations that perform or have performed the country psychosocial work will be performed. \n- A psychosocial tools package for work with victims of political violence will be published.\n- A permanent symposium  To hear” will be conducted once a month.\n- It is expected to create a laboratory of reflection and creation on listening: voices, faces, bodies and sounds beyond the horror.

(8, 'The principal researcher, Dr. Helder Nakaya, is an Assistant Professor at University of São Paulo, Brazil and an expert in Computational Systems Biology, bioinformatics, and molecular biology with a strong publication record in different subjects. Dr. Nakaya pioneered the development of Systems Vaccinology, an interdisciplinary field that combines systems-wide measurements, networks, and predictive modeling as a cross-functional approach to understanding vaccine responses. He has applied systems biology approaches to understand and predict the mechanisms of vaccine induced-immunity for a variety of human vaccines. Dr. Nakaya has extensive experience in microarray analyses and GEO database. His research group has developed programs that serve a broad range of purposes including: accessing GEO database and retrieving information from microarray experiments, generating world clouds from texts, normalizing the raw expression data from studies, performing quality control on microarray data, to name a few. This set of tools was used to download the 30,000+ GEO microarray studies into a local database. His experience also includes machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine and artificial neural network. Finally, as specialist in systems biology and graph theory, he is fully proficient in analyzing the topology and connectivity of networks composed of interactive users and subsequently identifying highly connected clusters.\nRecently, Dr. Nakaya was awarded a research grant to investigate long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) under hundreds of different perturbations and biological conditions using systems biology. For this, his group will utilize the 30,000+ microarray studies available on GEO database. Since this goal is directly affected by the fact that GEO studies are poorly annotated, the project proposed here will be crucial for the development of his team’s work on lncRNAs. \n The research collaborator Dr. Vinicius Maracaja-Coutinho, Assistant Professor of Universidad Mayor, Chile, is an expert in bioinformatics, databases and web-tools for biological sciences. He leads several projects related to scientific open access tools, new digital media, social networks and different aspects of collaborative and citizen science on research. Dr. Maracaja-Coutinho received 9 international awards for his work on science outreach and development of open-access integrative tools and databases. Several of his funded projects are related to the development of collaborative science projects, such as Dodo (www.dodofunding.com), a crowdfunding platform focused on biotechnology and life sciences projects; NimbusGene (www.nimbusgene.com), a software as a service (SaaS) that aims to integrate open-access bioinformatics algorithms and databases on the cloud; and The Non-coding RNA Databases Resource (www.ncrnadatabases.org), an integrative open-access repository of information related to ncRNAs obtained from more than 140 third-part databases. His background on collaborative science and bioinformatics will be crucial on the development of Crowdnotation. \n We plan to hire one local professional programmer with experience in the following languages and frameworks: SQL, Perl, Python, WordPress and BuddyPress; for the development of all back-end computational infrastructure. Additionally, we need to hire one front-end developer, and one interface designer with strong background in product development, user experience and user interface.', 'Crowdnotation: A Crowdsourcing Annotation Tool for Genomics Studies', 'Brazil,Chile', 'DNA microarray technology allows scientists to simultaneously measure the activity of all genes from cells and tissues under specific biological conditions. This powerful technique can be applied towards the study of a broad range of diseases, cancer types, drug treatments, gene regulatory mechanisms and even evolution. To date, more than one million microarray experiments have been performed and deposited into public databases, such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and ArrayExpress (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/). Thus, such databases are invaluable sources of biological information and can be useful for developing novel insights and data-driven hypotheses.\nHowever, when authors deposit a microarray study into GEO, they are free to describe the experiments using their own words. This author-based annotation method follows no defined ontology or classification standards, creating enormously difficulty for others when querying studies based on specific key words. For instance, studies about breast cancer can be deposited with different terms, such as "breast tumor", "mammary tumorigenesis", "carcinoma of the breast", "breast metastasis" and so on. Only human manual curation can properly annotate studies, as several computer programs have already attempted and failed at this task. Manual annotation is not a complex process, as it only requires notions of experimental design; most undergraduate students in biological sciences would successfully be able to accomplish this. The challenge lies in the ability to retrospectively manually annotate the more than 30,000 studies already available in GEO database. Since no single research laboratory is likely to have the resources to annotate all such studies, we will use the power of the crowd. This crowd would be composed by undergraduate students from all over the world and with diverse science backgrounds.\nWe propose to create a web-based tool named Crowdnotation, where students can remotely annotate the studies. In return, any student participating in the annotation will be included as an author in our publications. We believe that this alone serves as a strong incentive for a significant number of students. More importantly, to make the annotation process more attractive and enjoyable, Crowdnotation will have several gamification features, such as scores, rankings, friends and badges. This will promote engagement and ultimately improves performance and efficiency. A prototype of the web-based interface can be viewed in the following link: www.crowdnotation.org. \nAnnotation accuracy will be ensured through consistency among peers. For example, a study will only be considered annotated if at least 3 students classify it in the exact same way. From the education point of view, students will learn about the different types of experimental designs, correct use of negative and positive controls, will have access to the publications associated with microarray studies, and will gain significant knowledge in the field of modern molecular biology (genomics and transcriptomics). Also, this tool will allow us to monitor and compare the activity and performance of students from different countries and educational institutions.\nIf successful, this worldwide web-based community strategy will create a massive collaborative network of students working towards a common goal. In addition, students from remote areas of developing countries will gain a valuable opportunity to be part of a scientific collaboration and subsequent publication. In the future, this tool may be easily adapted to answer various scientific questions and for that, we will have the contact information of several thousand future scientists. Finally, all annotation data will be organized into a structured and open-accessed database, and the codes for Crowdnotation will be freely available for future developers.', 'We developed scripts that automatically download from GEO database the text information of all 30,000+ studies and 1,000,000+ microarray samples, and store them into our own SQL database. Our scripts also parse the text and create word clouds based on frequencies. Thus, we already have all the information we need regarding the studies from GEO database to start the Crowdnotation project.\n The data access layer (back-end) of Crowdnotation tool will be composed of two main databases. The first one (userdb) will contain all user information, social network and gamification implementations. The second one (studydb) will store information related to study annotation. Both databases will be implemented using open relational database management systems based on SQL (MySQL or PostgreSQL). The userdb will be developed behind the open source content management system &#40;CMS&#41; WordPress (www.wordpress.org), using the open source social networking package BuddyPress (www.buddypress.org) for the implementation and management of the social networking features. Perl and Python scripts will be used in the gamification system and for populating studydb. Both userdb and studydb will be directly integrated with WordPress and BuddyPress using PHP, Perl and Python languages.\n The presentation layer (front-end) will be developed using PHP, JavaScript and the front-end framework Bootstrap (www.getbootstrap.com). The user interface will be implemented in a responsive way, in order to be perfectly accessed from different devices (personal computer, tablets and cellphones). \n  Users will register/login via e-mail or via popular social networks programs, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter or Google+. The “Dashboard” page will display user basic information (i.e. full name, institution, background); and a summary of previous activities and achievements (i.e. scores, badges, ranking, friends’ activities). The “Let’s Annotate” button will lead to the “Annotation” page, which will contain the information for annotating a study.\n In the “Annotation” page, students will read the study description provided by the authors and perform the annotation. To facilitate this process, links to the original publication (if applicable), GEO external website, and a word cloud based on the frequencies of the words used by authors will be shown on the page. The latter will help users to quickly visualize common terms, accelerating the annotation process. There will be 3 main categories for high-level annotation (shown as buttons): cancer, (non-cancer) disease and infection. If users select one of the buttons using the mouse or finger (mobile platforms), the page will display sub-categories. For instance, selecting the infection button will make it appear on the page, additional buttons for “influenza”, “dengue”, “HIV”, “S. aureus”, among others. Users can select multiple buttons, as microarray studies may involve more than one condition or sample type. After selecting the “Done” button, the study annotation, user ID, and time spent by the user to annotate the study, will be stored in the studydb. \n Every 30 minutes, our scripts will analyze studydb and detect studies consistently annotated by three different users. Time, consistency, and number of annotated studies will be used to calculate the annotator score, which will be saved in userdb. Several gamification features such as badges, leaderboard, status, and goals will be implemented to promote engagement and encourage participation. This kind of crowdsourcing strategy has been widely applied in collaborative projects, as in the case of Google Image Labeler. Also, this gamification strategy has been used in known digital platforms, such Foursquare, Duolingo, and Reddit. \nWe will continue to use a marketing plan to target new users. Our initial target groups will be students with different majors/areas of concentration, many of which are expected to be from developing countries. We expect to reach this demographic via e-mail through university channels and by advertising on high visibility websites. GoogleAds and similar advertising services available from social networks (FacebookAds and LinkedInAds) may be used. A Blog, Facebook page, and Twitter profile will offer additional communication channels between the platform team and the target community. \nA “Landing” page containing the main features and select screenshots from our first prototype can be accessed at: www.crowdnotation.org. The final Studies database (studydb) will be made freely available to scientific community. The Crowdnotation and the database tools will be submitted for publication in high impact open access journals.', 'This project has 5 major expected outcomes including (1) full annotation of GEO database using defined ontologies, (2) development of programs for automatically annotate new studies based on machine-learning algorithms, (3) creation of a massive network of students sharing common interest for projects related to biological science, (4) valuable lessons about crowdsourcing projects and gamification tools, and (5) development of a freely available web-based tool and internet portal for future scientific crowdsourcing projects.\nThe annotation of 30,000+ studies from GEO database by a web-based community will have a great impact on genomics and systems biology. By attributing defined ontologies to the studies, one can quickly and easily retrieve microarray experiments performed using cells under “similar” or “opposite” biological conditions. This is a fundamental step towards data integration and meta-analyses, which can lead to finding and testing gene biomarkers or generating new biological insights and data-driven hypotheses.\nThis project will generate a huge amount of data coming from several thousand manual annotations. We can use machine-learning algorithms to learn from this data, and to develop a program that automatically annotates new studies. Word frequencies from “study summary” and “overall designed” texts, which are provided by authors will be used to train the program in classifying studies previously annotated by Crowdnotation tool. We will then test the program in studies not previously annotated nor contained in the training set. These will reveal if, which, and with what frequency specific words in authors-provided text can be used to annotate studies.\nThis project can only be completed with the work of thousands of students. Since Crowdnotation tool is also intended to promote and establish connections among annotators, we expect the formation of a massive student network rich with exchange of scientific ideas and social networking. The next section will describe how we will extract interesting information and trends once this network is analyzed.\n Very few studies have been published about the use of crowdsourcing to address life science questions. Thus, there is still no formula for succeeding in such projects. We hope to gain valuable knowledge regarding how to increase appeal and community adoption. We will learn how to determine and design the most relevant gamification features to engage students and will determine optimal strategies for targeting students based on their individual majors/areas of concentration, as well as across various countries/cultures. Our findings will be shared on our website and published in an open source scientific journal. \n The codes for Crowdnotation will be freely available for future developers to modify and adapt for their own crowdsourcing projects. Potentially, any scientific project that requires crowdsourcing and gamification can benefit from this tool. We obtained the website domain www.crowdsourcing4lifescience.org for hosting this project and future crowdsourcing projects.', 'Our limited access web-based tool will be available through user login and password. Thus, we will be able to monitor usage and track web activity of all users. Additionally, the Internet Protocol can reveal the source address of the annotator’s computer. By cross-referencing this information, we can evaluate usage and engagement by geographic locations, by friendship connections and even by students’ majors/areas of concentration. It is important to mention that this information will not be disclosed to anyone outside our group.\n As mentioned, after annotating a study, the user will receive points and badges that count towards his/her score and status, respectively. The score is partially based on annotation consistency among peers. By tracking the order of each study being annotated and its consistency score, we can evaluate the performance of annotators over time. Progression reports will be generated and sent to annotators weekly via e-mail for the duration of the project. The user can then re-annotate inconsistent studies. This exercise of re-annotating a study can help student to learn more about the study itself and about experimental design as well as improve his/her consistency in future annotations.\n We will also track the time spent by users to annotate a study. This information will help us to evaluate the quality of work by certain annotators. If a student regularly annotates studies at a rate that is considered too fast and the annotations regularly have poor consistency, this is likely due to lack of dedication from this student. On the other hand, studies that take a longer than average time to be annotated may have complex experimental designs, heterogeneous sample types, or are not properly described by the original authors. In this case, GEO database will be informed, and the information may be used to support changes in GEO data submission policies. \n If a study is not consistently annotated by six students, it will be removed from our database and we will annotate it ourselves. More importantly, we will attempt to identify the cause for difficulty in annotating such studies. Potential causes may include inherent complexity of the experiments, lack of information provided by authors, absence of defined ontologies to classify the study, or purely coincidental misannotation by six different students. With the exception of the latter two examples, such information may also be used to support policy changes that will improve the quality of GEO submissions.\n Finally, once the user network is established and score and annotation time are computed, useful knowledge can be extracted from these. We will analyze the network topology and connectivity and check for example if “good” annotators (defined by their high score) form highly connected clusters. This may suggest team effort and/or competitiveness. We will also evaluate if highly connected clusters are associated with annotators from the same geographic location or with similar scientific backgrounds, degrees of education, and/or majors/areas of concentration. The structure of such modules can point to how users organize themselves into small groups for resolving annotations.', '79,596.00', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/Letters_of_endorsement.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudgetHelderNakaya.xlsx', 48, 255, 'complete', 'yes', 1411248962, 'complete', 'No particular timeline described - i.e. how methods could be adapted to project successes/failures.

Through selected case studies, the project aims to draw lessons and insights that will form policy and decision-making.</p><p>The project responds foremost to theme 1 of the call but will also address issues identified under theme 3 and theme 4. It addresses theme 1 in its overall goal which is focused on contributing towards the development of research policy guidelines that will harmonize commercialization interests with the values espoused under open and collaborative models. By conducting case studies on contemporary research partnerships, the project will also address theme 3 by analyzing the role of organizational and institutional contexts represented by these partnerships while theme 4 will be addressed by focusing on the experiences, behaviour, choices, power relations and governance patterns within the selected case studies.</p><p>The project builds on Scinnovent&rsquo;s on-going research in Kenya and Rwanda on enhancing commercialization of research and strengthening the linkages between universities and public research institutes, and the private sector. The project will use two main data sources:</p><p>(i) Joint patent applications submitted to Kenya Industrial Property Institute ( KIPI) from 1990 &ndash; 2013 and</p><p>(ii) Research consortia funded under the National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation (NACOSTI) science, technology and innovation (STI) Small Grants Scheme.</p><p>Our analysis of the patent applications data shows that 278 applications were filed by various forms of partnerships (i.e. public-public; public-private; private-private) and that of these, 40 applications were granted. Similarly, NACOSTI has funded 45 multi-institutional research consortia. Case studies for this project will be derived largely from these two sources but will be supplemented by other sources as necessary to meet the objectives of the study.</p><p>The proposed study is predicated on the fact that the demand on universities and public research institutes to become more entrepreneurial and build linkages with private sector has been on the increase since the early 1990s (Caulfield et al., 2012). This third mission, requires universities and public research institutes to produce research with commercial potential and interact more closely with the intended beneficiaries of their research(Goransson and Brundenius, 2011; Goransson et al., 2009).</p><p>The inclusion of the third mission to the role of universities and public research institutes is driven largely by the need to supplement government funding of university research, as well as enhancing the role of universities as the engines of national development. Pursuing this third mission creates two problems with regards to open science which are the basis of this project:</p><p>First, is that partnering with industry requires that universities and public research institutes overcome some existing institutional and cultural barriers that may undermine their propensity to engage in open and collaborative research. Such barriers include the focus on academic excellence, teaching and research, coupled with incentives and rewards systems that emphasize on publications rather than commercial exploitation as the basis for promotions and growth.</p><p>Second, is that being largely publicly funded, universities create what is largely viewed as &lsquo;public goods&rsquo; while commercialization thrives on deriving private benefits i.e. exploiting products that are of a &lsquo;private goods&rsquo; nature. The need to make knowledge widely and publicly available, while at the same time encouraging researchers and inventors to commercialize their products creates a policy dilemma that faces the research community, particularly in the publicly-funded research establishments such as the universities and public research institutes (PRIs).</p><p>While on the one hand they are encouraged to commercialize their research through patenting, licencing and forming close relationships with industry (i.e. privatizing and protecting knowledge generated through public funds), on the other hand they are encouraged to share data and disseminate knowledge quickly and foster scientific progress (i.e. adopt an open science model). in the absence of clear research policy guidelines on how to behave in this potentially conflicting policy mix, researchers are likely to face practical as well as ideological difficulties while forging research partnerships and collaborations, especially with private sector actors whose motives may be more geared towards private gain as opposed to generating public goods.</p><p>This increasing adoption of open innovation requires that new kinds of relationships are developed between researchers and private firms. This project seeks to fill this void by contributing towards such research policy guidelines.</p>', '<p>The following questions underpin the study:</p><p>&bull; Are the policy positions on open science versus commercialization necessarily mutually exclusive or could they blend and work together for the good of the society?</p><p>Under what circumstances/contexts/conditions can they work together?</p><p>Are there examples of success derived from creatively blending these seemingly contradicting policy positions?</p><p>&bull; How does this policy conflict affect the behaviour of individual researchers engaged in collaborative partnerships?</p><p>How have they responded to this conflict and with what results? &bull; What sorts of strategies/training are required to blend these seemingly contradicting policy positions?</p><p>To address these questions, the study will seek to:</p><p>1. Determine the extent to which commercialization policies and open science policies actually conflict and the circumstances/contexts/conditions under which they could be blended to work together</p><p>2. Document the experiences, behaviour patterns and practical challenges faced by researchers working in open collaborative research partnerships</p><p>3. Identify the strategies and training needs required to support researchers engaged in collaborative partnerships to deal with conflicts created by the opposing policy requirements</p><p>4. Determine the extent to which potential conflicts over IP (desire to commercialize) constitute a barrier to collaborative research partnerships</p><p>5. Investigate how the various collaborative research partnerships are governed (formal versus informal) and the influence of each type of governance in resolving potential conflicts over IP ownership and data sharing.</p><p>This study will follow a case study approach (Yin, 1994; Thomas, 1998) and will use contemporary examples derived from</p><p>(i) joint patent applications submitted to KIPI (1990 &ndash; 2013) as well as</p><p>(ii) research consortia/networks supported by NACOSTI (2008 &ndash; 2013) to investigate the challenges posed to researchers in these collaborations as a result of the policy contradictions pitting open science vis-&agrave;-vis commercialization. The cases to be studied will be selected to reflect:</p><p>a) type of research partnerships (i.e. public &ndash; public; public &ndash; private; private &ndash; private and networks/consortia)</p><p>b) economic sectors/thematic focus of the research (to highlight any specifics due to research traditions and practices/disciplinary orientations)</p><p>c) organizational cultures and institutional framework (including incentives, policies and power) and</p><p>d) successful versus unsuccessful applications).</p><p>Consistent with the case study approach, this study will follow a largely qualitative approach involving a systematic collection, organization and interpretation of material derived from document reviews, interviews, observations, focus groups and workshops.</p><p>The study will triangulate a number of approaches involving</p><p>(i) document reviews in which a number of key policy and strategy documents will be consulted. Issues emanating from this initial documentary review shall be put to selected practitioners and policymakers through short, exploratory key informant interviews: The key informants will be chosen for their knowledge and distinctive viewpoints about the issues under investigation.</p><p>The key informant interviews will be a precursor to more in-depth focused interviews with researchers. We shall aim to interview about 10 - 12 key informants distributed amongst policymakers, academics, private sector. The results of this key informant interviews; together with the documentary review of the policies shall provide a sound basis for designing in-depth interviews with specific case studies.</p><p>The use of in-depth interviews will allow the research team to obtain tacit knowledge including how decisions were made in the partnerships and the influence/details of the application of the rules and policy guidelines; it will also help to elicit the perception of individuals/groups on the institutional context, power dynamics, organizational culture and support networks and how these (perceptions) manifest in particular patterns of decision-making and application.</p><p>To interrogate power relations, raise awareness and initiate a process of dialogue amongst the different actors, the study will employ focus group discussions (FGDs) to cater for respondents who find it easier to participate in a group discussion rather than be interviewed separately or fill in a questionnaire (Johnson, H and Mayoux, L, 1998).</p><p>Finally, we shall hold stakeholder workshops to encourage interactions and disseminate the findings. Data emanating from interviews (key informant and in-depth interviews) will be audio recorded (with interviewees consent), transcribed and translated to English (where applicable), and exported to Nvivo software for coding into emerging themes and subthemes. Some minimal quantitative data will be collected. Such quantitative data will be double entered into a computer database designed using MS-Access application.</p><p>Regular file back-up will be done to avoid any loss or tampering. Back up files will be stored in CDs and/or flask discs. Data cleaning and validation will be performed in order to achieve a clean dataset that will be exported into a Statistical Package format (using SPSS version 20.0) ready for analysis.</p>', '<p>This project will aim to combine policy influencing with original academic contributions. We shall use a range of publications including</p><p>(i) working papers to disseminate preliminary findings and allow stakeholders to engage with the research outputs and obtain feedback to strengthen analysis before final analytical papers and</p><p>(ii) Policy briefs written in consultation with policymakers and senior level practitioners in the relevant ministries to address specific policy issues raised by the study.

(10, '<p>The most important skills and expertise of the principal researcher for this project may be explained under three different headings which are not mutually exclusive, but complementary in nature.</p><ol><li>Extensive fieldwork experience: The principal researcher has worked as a CSIR-NIF Fellow, under the guidance of Prof. Anil K. Gupta (Founder, Honeybee Network), at the National Innovation Foundation (NIF), India, an organisation for promoting grassroots innovations and traditional knowledge. NIF, which is also a part of the Honeybee Network, gives high importance to protection of intellectual property rights of grassroots innovators and traditional knowledge holders. But what makes the approach of the network unique is the concept of Innovation Commons, which promotes free and open horizontal sharing of information. In other words, the network promotes open sharing of innovations among individual innovators and royalty sharing is advocated only when the innovations are put into commercial uses by any firm. The work of the principal researcher as a CSIR-NIF Fellow involved extensive grassroots level work and interactions with knowledge holders from across India. It has also helped in gaining grassroots level experience of promoting sharing of information among different stakeholders in the innovation chain. The doctoral research of the principal investigator also involved extensive fieldwork.</li><li>Interdisciplinary research experience and exposure to quantitative/ qualitative methodologies: As one may observe from the publications of the principal researcher, he has been involved in different interdisciplinary projects in the area of intellectual property law. It is particularly important to highlight the interest and experience of the principal researcher in empirical legal studies as well as behavioral law and economics. His doctoral thesis (which was recently published by the Cambridge University Press) was an empirical legal study using the mixed methods research methodology. His exposure to different quantitative and qualitative data analysis methods will be of help in the research design and successful completion of the proposed project.</li><li>Specific experience in the area of open access to research data: The post-doctoral research of the principal researcher (at the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium) was in the area of open access to knowledge resources, and more particularly, his work was trying to identify different kinds of practices, motivations (economic and non-&shy;economic) and legal conditions that drives data sharing among projects and researchers. As part of this work, he has designed different questionnaires for quantitative and qualitative data collection from researchers working in the fields of genomics and metagenomics. He has also conducted semi-structured interviews with researchers in different parts of the world. He was also involved in different large-scale EU funded projects and this include EU FP7 projects titled MICROB3 and GENCOMMONS. All these aspects are expected to be helpful in proper planning and completion of the proposed project, within the suggested time-frame. The external adviser for the project, Prof. Tom Dedeurwardere (http://biogov.uclouvain.be/staff/dedeurwaerdere/tom.html), is an eminent scholar working in the area of knowledge commons. His guidance and periodic review of the project will be of considerable help in the successful completion of the project.</li></ol>', 'Breaking the Barriers of Knowledge Sharing in India', 'India', '<p>Background and Overview:</p><p>Access to knowledge resources, particularly scholarly publications and basic research data, are vital for the progress of science. Unfortunately, in spite of radical developments in information technology and resulting reduction in costs of communication of knowledge resources, gaining access to knowledge resources is challenging, particularly for researchers and students in countries with lesser economic resources. For example, the pay-walls around scholarly publications, including those arising from public funded research, considerably reduce the accessibility of scholarly publications to the wider public.</p><p>Similar is the case of resources like basic research data, which could be shared far more widely and effectively with the help of new digital technologies. While many leading academicians and educational institutions around the globe are actively trying to promote the sharing of knowledge resources, many countries are still struggling to enable an active knowledge sharing environment even within their own geographical territories. India is an example in this regard. Though India has some islands of excellence in different fields of education, access to quality education and knowledge resources is still a challenging dream for millions of its citizens. The extent of open sharing of publications as well as basic research data from even the resource rich public funded institutions within the country is still at negligible levels. In this context, this project aims to explore in detail the major intrinsic and extrinsic motivations influencing the decision making of the Indian academic scholars with regard to sharing (or non-sharing) of knowledge resources produced by them.</p><p>The project will also try to analyse the effectiveness of the current approaches adopted by the funding agencies and the Indian government with regard to sharing of knowledge resources from public funded projects and public funded institutions. The project aims to bring forward legal and policy recommendations based on the quantitative and qualitative findings from the study.</p><p>Research questions:</p><p>The four broad research questions that will be addressed by this project are:</p><p>1. How far the Indian academic community share their knowledge resources like publications and basic research data, beyond their individual campuses/ personal networks?</p><p>2. What are the various intrinsic and extrinsic motivations influencing the decision making of Indian academic scholars with regard to sharing of the knowledge resources produced by them?</p><p>3. How effective are the current approaches adopted by the funding agencies and the Government of India, with regard to sharing of knowledge resources from public funded projects and public funded institutions?</p><p>4. What are the legal and policy steps that can help in more open sharing of knowledge resources, given the findings from the previous three questions?</p><p>Relevance of the study:</p><p>Though many scholars have analysed the extent of open access publishing in India, not many studies have focused on the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of academic scholars in India with regard to sharing of their knowledge resources like publications and research data. Identification of the major intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for sharing of knowledge resources can help in evolving better and more effective legal and policy measures in this area. By engaging in an exploratory study in this direction, this project aims to contribute to the global open access movement and a new development paradigm based on shared knowledge resources. While this study will be done in the context of India, the unique methodological approach taken in the study as well as the recommendations from the study will be of relevance for many other countries facing similar challenges in access to knowledge resources.</p>', '<p>The study will be using the mixed methods approach in research. The quantitative components in the study will include data relating to the trends in sharing of knowledge resources by the Indian academic community. Data in this regard will be primarily collected from top 10 educational institutions in India in the fields of arts, engineering, law, management, medicine and science. This data will be complemented with data from the Inflibnet database of the University Grants Commission, which is a government supported platform for sharing of educational resources.</p><p>The quantitative components in the study will also include data from an empirical survey which will be conducted among the faculty members and researchers in those top 10 institutions, so as to identify the various intrinsic and extrinsic motivations influencing their decision making with regard to sharing (or non-sharing!) of knowledge resources produced by them. Semi-structured questionnaires will be used in this regard.</p><p>The qualitative components in the study will include data from semi-structured interviews with some of the leading academic scholars and funding agencies working in those fields. This will help to explore in detail the specialisation specific bottlenecks/ incentives (if any!) for sharing of knowledge resources.</p><p>The interviews will also attempt to get their perspectives on the major findings from the empirical survey. Analysis of the current copyright legislation and different open access policies currently adopted by the funding agencies and the government also form an integral part of the qualitative analyses. Through this unique methodological approach, the project will contribute to the wider goal of the OSCDNet in exploring the optimal conditions under which open approaches to research and collaboration can lead to development in the Global South.</p>', '<p>As discussed earlier, not many studies have focused on the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations influencing the attitude of academic scholars in India with regard to sharing of their knowledge resources like publications and research data. The quantitative and qualitative findings from the proposed study will help in identifying these aspects in detail and the study will also try to highlight the specialisation specific differences (if any!) with regard to sharing of knowledge resources among the academic scholars in India. These findings, along with the analysis of the effectiveness of the present open access policies adopted by the government and the funding agencies, will certainly help the policy makers and funding agencies to evolve optimal legal and policy reforms in this area for wider sharing of knowledge resources.</p><p>All the findings from the study will be disseminated through the following channels:</p><p>First, the study envisages the publishing of a monograph at the end of the project. It will outline all the important findings from the project as well as the major legal/ policy recommendations. To make sure that the proposed monograph is accessible for people across the world, the project will publish the work simultaneously in the form of an open access e-book and in print format.</p><p>Second, some of the findings from the work will be published in the form of articles. In all those cases, special efforts will be taken to ensure that those articles are openly available for people across the world.</p><p>Third, all the quantitative data collected as part of the project and the detailed description of the methodology adopted in the study, will be shared through an open access website of the project. This will not only enable easier replication of the study in other countries/ fields of study, but will also enable other researchers across the world to use the data for their own analyses. OSCDNet may provide direct links to the database and/or host the data directly in its website. The primary goal is to ensure that any researcher from across the world should be able to use the data generated as part of this project.</p><p>Finally, the project also envisages the hosting of an international conference in Delhi at the end part of the project. This conference aims to bring together leading scholars in the area and it will discuss in detail the findings from the project and also the emerging trends in the area of open access to knowledge resources. All the sessions of the conference will be video recorded and they will be shared through freely accessible platforms like Youtube for wider dissemination.</p>', '<p>The success and impact of the project can be evaluated through multiple paths. This includes examining&ndash;</p><p>1. Whether all the quantitative data collected as part of the project has been released in an open access format through the website of the project, without undue delays?</p><p>2. Whether all the articles published as part of the project are accessible in free and open access formats for people across the world?</p><p>3. Whether the monograph published as part of the project is accessible in free and open access format for people across the world?</p><p>4.

The underlying tensions are characteristic of scientific development in peripheral contexts, often expressed as a trade-off between visibility and international recognition, on the one hand, and the industrialization and effective application of such knowledge, on the other. Although we are mainly focusing on Latin America (particularly Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico), one of the peripheral contexts of international science (Vessuri, 1983; Kreimer, 2012; Vessuri &amp; Kreimer, 2014), the project aims to extend its analyses to other significant regions. The following questions are posed as a starting point:</p><ol><li>How are Latin American research groups integrated into international research networks?</li><li>What are the respective roles of epistemological and technical motivations, of international visibility, and the social use of knowledge?</li><li>Who are the most frequent partners and how is power and decision-making distributed--including research agendas--within the networks?</li><li>What other stakeholders participate in the formation of these networks besides research teams themselves?</li><li>What are the variables determining the participation of Latin American research groups in more or less open networks?</li><li>What is the role played by international cooperation policies in each country with regards to the integration of collaborative networks?</li><li>Under what conditions can open collaboration networks contribute to an effective use of knowledge in peripheral societies?</li></ol><p>As has been noted in the scholarly literature, the proportion of the knowledge produced in peripheral contexts that is effectively used within those societies themselves is rather low. We put forward the concept of &ldquo;Applicable Knowledge Not Applied&rdquo; (Kreimer &amp; Thomas, 2006) to account for this issue. In recent years, however, the traditional circumstances of knowledge production have been modified: globalization processes taking place in science, together with the formation of huge research networks generates, at once, risks and opportunities in peripheral regions. Among the risks we have identified the process of &lsquo;cognitive exploitation&rsquo; (Kreimer &amp; Zukerfeld, 2014). Conversely, the formation of South-South networks that empower their own capacities without the mediation of hegemonic groups (whose agendas usually disregard social needs in Southern contexts) can be identified as one of its major opportunities. Therefore, the questions to be addressed in our research project correspond to the RT4: Potential Impacts of Open &amp; collaborative science.</p><p>The theoretical framework of the project is based on three different contributions from the STS field:</p><p>(a) the definition of social problems is understood as a contingent and conflictive co-production process (Jasanoff, 2004), problematically related to the production of scientific knowledge, as well as to the scientific treatment of such problems (Kreimer, 2014);</p><p>(b) the historical links between scientific research centers and peripheries--which we have previously analyzed in terms of &lsquo;integrated subordination&rsquo;--(Kreimer, 2010), where research groups from peripheral contexts tend to adopt hegemonic research agendas; and</p><p>(c) in regard to the open and collaborative modes of knowledge production, we draw on the above-mentioned concept of cognitive exploitation. Latin American countries are taken as a case study, conducting empirical analysis of two knowledge production networks with diverse features.</p><p>The first one is tropical disease research networks, particularly Chagas disease research (tripanosomiasis Americana, which affects over eight million people in this region [WHO, 2014]). Many of the most prestigious researchers from Argentina and Brazil have actively engaged in these networks. Preliminarily, we have observed that in spite of international efforts, genomics networks of T. Cruzi (the causal agent of the disease) actually help &ldquo;purify&rdquo; an object--e.g., strings of DNA--that ultimately obtains autonomy from the actual life conditions of local populations and, ultimately, from the social problem itself. Science policies reinforce this situation, encouraged by an explicit ideology of increasing the flows of international cooperation, but implicitly oriented towards fostering collaboration with the most prestigious research centers in order to increase local researchers&rsquo; international visibility.</p><p>The second case is the study of international networks related to knowledge production in the social sciences in Mexico. The aim is to identify the factors and motivations that lead researchers and teams to take on problem agendas or internationally &lsquo;hyped&rsquo; conceptual and methodological frameworks, as well as the effects of such interaction upon the development of the social sciences. We encourage reflection on this issue beyond the theoretical frameworks of Mexican society by exploring the networks to which researchers and institutions are linked, understanding their action as practices, as well as analyzing the dynamics they engage in by using technological objects and platforms for scientific communication and knowledge production. (See references in methodological section)</p>', '<p>The methodological strategy will be deployed both in the analysis of primary and secondary data on the basis of qualitative (1) and quantitative techniques (2).</p><p>For the first stage we will start with a &ldquo;following the actors&rdquo; (1.1) strategy, an approach raised by laboratory studies, consisting of following the research groups at different loci of knowledge production, and asking participants to provide data to generate a description of the network. Then (1.2), we will identify groups and actors related to the networks, according to the links that can be identified through the Internet as well as institutional documents and various sources written in other media.</p><p>For the second stage (2.1) we will observe the features and analyze the dynamics of collaboration between groups, using scientometric tools. These analytical resources have evolved considerably during recent years, allowing us to analyze large sets of information while conducting more elaborate research questions (Blondel et al., 2008). New sets of variables can be incorporated into the analysis (from the traditional citation indexes to a thorough analysis of the contests of abstracts and papers), which yield more accurate results in terms of thematic grouping and connections (Grauwin &amp; Jensen, 2011).</p><p>Emerging dynamics from the research networks&rsquo; production (texts, documents, and papers) can be observed adding graphic analysis to complex datasets (Bastian et al., 2009; Rafols &amp; Leydesdorff, 2010). Finally, developing tools that allow us to include time as a variable will provide us with a diachronic view of the complex dataset. This in turn will allow us to determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of networks, the participation of non-academic actors, and the intensity in terms of co-authorships, as well as to map the institutional, disciplinary and thematic spaces. During this stage we will also discuss the training of young researchers (2.2), understanding that mobility (in terms of tacit knowledge embodied in persons) is an important form of scientific cooperation. More structured data can be obtained from research paper analysis which in turn, can be compared to those mentioned by the actors, providing a more exhaustive survey of collaboration dynamics. At this stage, two workshops will be held (in Argentina and Mexico) with representatives from non-governmental organizations (e.g. DNDi), science policy and decision makers and researchers from different fields, in order to create a space to present the preliminary results of our research and to assess the risks and benefits of open collaborative networks.</p><p>Finally, integrating the data obtained in (1) and (2), we will observe how the networks are articulated in terms of the motivations of actors, whether they respond to institutional policies, relationships with other actors to industrialize knowledge, or to other factors that operate as stimuli for the formation of networks. This will be contrasted with the analysis of (discursive) network objectives, the goals of funding agencies and institutions that sponsor them, and the overall funding structure.</p><p>References</p><p>Bastian, M., Heymann, S., &amp; Jacomy, M.

This is initially from the Latin American perspective, and immediately after, we will identify the central variables that make it possible to extend the analysis to other networks which scientists from other developing regions are participating in.</p><p>Secondly, departing from the empirical data on tropical disease and social problem research networks in Latin America, we aim to enhance the conceptual framework put forward by OCSD Network and to refine the analytical methodologies in order to compare different networks and settings, as well as the role of the various platforms and support structures for the development of science in the Global South. Additionally, the outcomes of the project are expected to raise awareness among the stakeholders implicated in the topics under study. Therefore, 4 types of stakeholders will be primarily considered:</p><p>1) Policymakers in the areas of S&amp;T management (particularly in International cooperation offices), as well as in the fields of Health and Social affairs.</p><p>2) Non-governmental organizations and/or research funding agencies.</p><p>3) Scholars: especially junior researchers from life and SSH sciences.</p><p>4) Social groups affected by the studied problems and needs.</p><p>Communicating results--as well as interesting policymakers, non-governmental organizations, and S&amp;T funding agencies--demands the creation of briefing documents summarizing the project&rsquo;s findings and providing a critical consideration of the risks and benefits of open and collaborative science in the selected countries. Researchers will be engaged via dedicated workshops that are expected to facilitate the exchange of expertise and experience and provide a reflexive approach to the problems and findings. Considerations of the risks and benefits of open collaboration are expected to be included in scientific research and science policy agendas. Social groups, on the other hand, can only be engaged after stakeholders (1), (2) and (3) have been engaged.</p>', '<p>Monitoring and evaluation will mainly depend on four indicators that are directly linked to the proposed objectives. These indicators are intended to reveal whether, and under which circumstances:</p><p>1) The analysis of the networks does actually provide new insights into risks and benefits, as well as new clues for future investigations; as a result of the empirical work, a detailed list of the variables influencing the dynamics of scientific networks will be produced. A preliminary sample of these variables includes: - Confluence with national S&amp;T and social policies; - Degrees of technical specialization and dependence on equipment (very different from one scientific field to another); - Origin of the networks&rsquo; leaders; - Cognitive and applied interests of the actors involved; - Existence of a social and economic fabric that is able to industrialize the knowledge produced; - Local structures for training young scientists; - Formal and informal features of the networks (or &ldquo;degree of formalization&rdquo;); - Types and interests of funding agencies. - Social organization and engagement of other actors and stakeholders.</p><p>2) New conceptual and methodological proposals can be formulated and applied to other regions; since the research will focus on Latin American dynamics, the aforementioned findings should bring up topics to be tested in a comparative way, in order to differentiate local variables from global ones (affecting all similar research networks including groups from other regions).</p><p>3) It is possible to affect the ideals of cooperation underlying international cooperation policies in S&amp;T; during the workshop proposed, as well other activities, the common view of international cooperation as &ldquo;something good in itself&rdquo; must be challenged, showing the risks and benefits of stimulating other kinds of open scientific networks. 4) Effectively engaging concerned stakeholders; besides the interaction with leading scientists, an indicator of the project&rsquo;s success will be the outcome that some key social actors can actually engage in orienting collaborative international research to an effective use of knowledge.</p>', '74046', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/Letter_Dr_Kreimer5.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudgetTemplatePK1.xlsx', 33, 252, 'complete', 'yes', 1411228008, 'complete', 'A valuable project from an experienced team addressing core issues for the program, particularly how south-south collaborations are situated.

She is Vice Chairperson of Executive Board of COAR, Confederation of Open Access Repositories.', 'Strengthening of a community of practice to improve open information quality and development a proof of concept for regional data repositories', 'Quality of information:  8 countries. Argentina,  Brasil, Colombia, Chile,  Ecuador, El Salvador,  México, Perú.  Data repository:  Proof of concept. 3 countries to be defined, one research comunity RedCLARA', 'The research is mainly based in the topic Theme 2 (T2): Infrastructures & Technologies. Also covers some aspects of “communities of practices” and “motivations”.\nNowadays Latin America has a strong presence of Open Access in terms of institutional and journal repositories.  Directories like Open DOAR shows the relevance. Also, DOAJ shows a production not reflected in traditional research outputs in services like Scopus or Wos.(1,2)  This reality have been explained by the lack of commercial editors, government support, influence of SciELO, cultural factors, among others (3,4) \n\nIn the area of information repositories a relevant experience has been LA Referencia. It was the result of a project presented by RedCLARA, funded by Regional Public Goods of IDB until 2013. It´s purpose was the creation of an agreed strategy, and technical pilot for the maintenance of a federated network of scientific institutional repositories to give greater visibility to Latin American science. At the end of 2012, an agreement was signed by Science and Technology governmental authorities of 9 Latin American countries. (Argentina, Brasil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, México, Perú, Venezuela y El Salvador) to institutionalize this initiative (5)  \n\nFrom November 2013 (launch of the pilot) growth from 320.000 documents (journal articles, Master and PhD thesis) to almost 1 million in Aug. 2014, and 10-15% monthly growth in unique visitors.  The strength is based on a common agreement for interoperability, based on Driver 2, and it is exploring adoption of some elements of OpenAire (EU) to increase global interoperability (6) \n\nIn this process, Peru and Argentina passed national legislation in 2013 to implement national open access strategies, as well as Mexico in 2014. The global research community working on COAR explains that repositories are one of the main tools to support Open Access, preserve the intellectual production and give of information for governments and funding agencies of the results. However there is number of research and applications challenges identified (7). Furthermore, this proposal is aligned with the research and services needs expressed by the regional governments (8) \n\nAlternatives for national harvesting systems, interoperability and information quality.\n\nNowadays, there is no dominant technical platform for national of regional harvesters. But at the level of institutional repositories the paradigm is Dspace.  A community of practice among government’s specialist and supporting agencies must be nurtured to support good practices and technology advances in national harvesters. In parallel, metadata quality is an ongoing process and a vital input for research in open access. Clearly, guidelines help in this process, but still are needed data transformations due to the diversity of sources:  Tools for metadata diagnostics and transformations is strongly demanded, as well as adaptative interfaces to support access by smartphones and tablets in a region with poor internet infrastructure.\n\nRequirements and conditions for open scientific data and proof of concept of data repositories.\n\nThere is a demand to study data policies, conditions for use by Latin American researchers and to develop proof of concept in data repositories. It will facilitate research, replicability, reuse, and integrity. Furthermore, legislation in Peru an Argentina will demand solutions; and participation of Mexico and Chile in OECD involves the development of public policy (9)  \n\nInternational organizations such as UNESCO and OECD have expressed the importance of this issue (10)   Also data management plans are requirements of funding agencies in developed countries (11)  The first major call of Horizonte2020 called for research in these infrastructures (12)  Finally, some journals require data submission and even dominant commercial players, such a Elsevier, publishes a list of Supported Data Repositories (13) \n\nHowever, few examples exist in the region. Some are OpenBio in Brasil, advances for the Astronomy in Chile, and ongoing efforts with clinical trials. Mexico, also, shows a leading participation in international registries such as re3data.org or databib.org (14)  Essentially, major disciplinary data repositories are outside the region. A key component of open science is missing, especially for the so called “long tail data”, the results of research financed by governments, and solutions for regional publications.  \n\nResearch is needed for an alternative that can be adapted and adopted to Latin American conditions, transferable, open source, integrated with the flow of production, scalable, with a common basic mandatory metadata and definition of best alternatives for access rights. This must be aligned with the identification of needs and barriers in scientific communities to use data repositories and a proof of concept to derive lesson with a federated approach.\n\nReferences at the end.', 'Assuming that “enable a greater understanding of whether, and the conditions under which open approaches to science could contribute to development outcomes in the Global South”, this project covers some aspects of the ideals of OCSDNet. Namely, supporting research and capabilities for stakeholder with responsibilities in policy and service provision and exploring research in infrastructure through proof of concepts.  The research is applied and could be an interesting partner to OCSDNet goals in terms of including policy actors into the network. It does not address directly linkages with ToC. But, expects suggestions in this area.  \n\nThe project, as said, it is based on demands expressed by policy bodies according to the development goals and strategic plans. It assumes that it is important consolidate information quality, as well as to advance in regional data repositories. If not, in medium term, all the data from the south will be preserved in the north, including those totally or partially funded by the governments research funds. \n\nThe methodology is according to the expected results:\n\n1. As a principle, technologies should be open source, and feasible to adapt to the technical infrastructure and expertise of human resources in the region. Tt will use agile methodologies and should considerer alternatives for adaptative technology. \n2.  Definition and reach of expected results will be agreed previously with stakeholders: Directives and technical managers in charge of implementing national repository strategies and open access. Each could involve the community according to national realities. \n3.  Complexities of data rights will be dealt previously. It will work initially with communities that are willing to participate with rights very open to reuse. Alternatives of CC will be set before the proof of concept. \n4.  A nonexclusive focus is long tail data. Relevant data is not only produced by huge infrastructures (big data). A vital one is produced in the context of research projects (usually financed by the government for 2 to 3 years). Also, some legislations (for example Argentina) declare that data should be open after 5 years. \n\nAccording to each result:\n\n1. Articulation of a community of practice among specialist. These are already defined by each government and is a combination of engineers and information specialists.  Based on Agile Methodology, general virtual meeting will be held every 4 months. One workshop is planned during the project. General terms of reference of this project components will be agreed; as well presentations and support for studies (Workshop: CAD 23,650. Approx. 15 People, 3 days).\n  \n2.  Tools for metadata diagnostics and transformations at aggregate levels. Remote installation in national repositories using LA Referencia solution. Diagnostics tool for national administrator implemented as “SAS” for other countries. (Diagnosis by facets). \n\n3.  Adaptative. Possible adoption of Bootstrap at the presentation layer. Proof of concept of a harvest and presentation of a front-end (retrieval interface) of the  data and publication links. \n\n4.  Feasibility Study on Data Repositories. Terms of Reference will be agreed previously Includes Technology and Mandatory Metadata for interoperability. A suggestion is to explore alternatives based in Dspace; Fedora, or with API to Open Journal System &#40;OJS/Dataverse&#41;. The study will be subcontracted.  \n\n5.  Identification of needs and barriers in scientific communities for Open Data. Recently CONICYT Chile published a policy proposal http://datoscientificos.cl/). Based on Delphi Methods, a study will gather relevant information. 4 countries will participate selecting experts. Potential areas:  Editors, Funding Bodies, Library Directors; Researchers. RedCLARA will participate with a scientific community and logistics for virtual meetings. \n\nSpecifically, a specific candidate is LAGO (Large Aperture Gamma Ray Burst, Observatory). Is a researcher community of almost 40 researchers in 15 institutions of Latin America, developing alternatives for data repositories. \n\n6.  Adaptation and Technology Proof of Concept. Includes platform installation. Also a sample of at least 3 countries (E.g., 2 journals for country or a combination with a research community). As said, a research community will be selected by RedCLARA. It includes survey ex post of usability. Other impact measures are not viable due to time. \n\n7.  Communication: Web site with space dedicated to the project and publication of all the result. Relevant news to open access lists. Involvement of RedCLARA with two virtual days for results dissemination.', 'It will set a basic infrastructure and lessons that will help to develop regional and national services for open science in the future with a direct policy relevance based on the involvement of relevant actors in policy making and service provision. It will supports researchers in the field to study the provision of services for OCS. Probably, it will not answer all the research questions regarding the collaborative nature, but it provides interoperable infrastructures and services to support that goal.  \n\nMain outcomes, General:\n\n1. A set of technologies that can improve quality of metadata with benefits to information repository managers in charge of national open access strategies.\n2. A network of collaboration on good practices among specialist in charge of implementing national repository strategies\n3.  Studies on technical alternatives to implement interoperable data repositories with proposals for metadata standards.\n4.  Studies on opportunities and barriers to implement data repositories among relevant stakeholders of the region.\n5 .  Alternatives for scientific editors and research communities regarding infrastructure and challenges to link data with publications and vice versa.\n6. An interoperable infrastructure, adaptative and transferable, that can interconnect with collaborative platforms.\n\nSpecific: \n\n1. Tools and methodologies that will be used for national repositories to diagnose and improve metadata quality. Month 7\n2.  Community of practice among engineers and information specialists working in governments regarding services for Open Science. Virtual meetings and workshop with presentations of mid-term results. Month 12. \n3.  Feasibility study on data repositories and metadata requirements for interoperability that can be used by any actor of the region. Month 9\n4. A Delphi study in a sample of countries (4), regarding needs and barriers for open data policies. Month 8\n5.  A proof of concept of a data repository. Installation: Month 12.

A front end (in the Journal; or the Data repository) that makes the cross links; a data repository to link from any infrastructure. Month 21.\n\nAdditionality impacts\n\nIn R&D literature, these are considered after the end of the project.  \n4 countries improve the quality of repository metadata measured by % of levels transformations levels. \n2 countries decide to install and operate a pilot data repository after the project for “long tail data.”  \n4 new open data repositories are installed in the region using the technology develop in the proof of concept. \nOne project is independently developed by the community of practice. E.g. Common standards for usage (metrics) with distributed statistics. Eg.  Open-Access-Statistics (OA-Statistics) or IRUS-UK (15) . \n1 project for a pilot service, using the results, is presented to funding agencies after completion of the project.

Over the years, combinations of natural and man-made factors have been the main hurdles to cross in order to solve the growing food insecurity problem that affects many parts of the country. However, other factors such as the low levels of technology use in agriculture sector are also partly responsible for the challenge to persist.  The country has a food security programme designed to provide the platform for chronically food insecure households to become food secured. Since 2010, the second phase of Food Security Program(FSP) has been under implementation. In the country, there have been several food security interventions initiated by a diverse set of actors or development partners basically with the common objective of strengthening the livelihoods of chronically food insecure households- the food security programme under implementation has four distinct components: Productive Safety Net Programme(PSNP), Household Asset Building Programme(HABP), Complementaty Investment programme(CCI) and Resettlement Programme.  The programs are linked to one common outcome which is known as Graduation- a process whereby recipients of support  move from a position of depending on external assistance to a condition where they no longer need this support, and can therefore exit the programme. In this research we are going to investigate the various constraints that stand in the way of enabling critically food insecure household to graduation or effectiveness of food security interventions in general, and propose technological solution to streamline food security intervention programs. To investigate the state of access to open infrastructure and food security intervention programs as well as needs and research priorities, the following research questions become pertinent:            \n• Will OCS lead to a better understanding of the wider context and constraints affecting food insecure households better?\n• How does access to un-tethered open data derived from access to open infrastructure could eradicate or minimize the potential effects of food security programmes- specific constraints?\n• How does access to un-tethered open data derived from access to open infrastructure can eradicate or minimize the potential effects of location- specific constraints on  graduation processes?\n• How does access to un-tethered open data derived from access to open infrastructure can eradicate or minimize the potential effects of market- specific constraints on graduation processes?\n• How does access to un-tethered open data derived from access to open infrastructure can eradicate or minimize the potential effects of food security beneficiaries- specific constraints?\n• How does access to un-tethered open data derived from access to open infrastructure can eradicate or minimize the potential effects of environment or context - specific constraints?\n• How does access to un-tethered open infrastructure enhance the effectiveness of food security intervention programs implemented by several development partners?\n•How does un-tethered open data derived from open infrastructure could be enabler to Graduation and Resilience?  \n\nBy investigating the relationships between access to open infrastructure and food security intervention programs, the research will provide empirical evidence of the dynamics, outcomes and implications for policy and practice of the application and integration of open infrastructure in food security intervention programs. As well, key drivers for effective integration of open infrastructure into food security intervention programs will be identified.', 'This will be an action-oriented research implemented under two phases. Phase One will include conducting a survey in two selected regional states. Sample Woredas(woreda refers to a locality of the lowest tier in the governance system of Ethiopia) in the Amhara and Tigray regional states where food insecurity is deepening will be determined after gathering the necessary information from various sources.\nThe aim of Phase One of the proposed research is to, among others, document the diverse set of constraints that stand in the way of smooth and accelerated graduation of chronically food insecure households. The results of Phase One will guide Phase Two where the diverse set of constraints are analyzed and prioritized and a prototype system that show cases the true effects of open infrastructure on addressing one of the key development challenges of the country will be developed.      \nThe research will be carried out with open collaboration(or distributed collaboration) at its core- providing the platform for stakeholders to be involved at any level in the project’s lifespan, and the survey data will be available for public access so as others interested will be able to use or repurpose them. Tools produced such as the prototype system will also be made available for open license use.\nIt is expected that the OCSDNET will provide us the necessary support during the project period and the panel of international advisors will provide mentoring to the research team on the following areas so as to enable the team accomplish the assignment:\n• Research Methodology/Instrument Development;\n• Reporting Framework; and\n• Outcome Assessment Framework \n\nMain Data Collection and Analysis Method:\n\na.

To this end, an experiment as well as a control group that enables us to measure the success or impact of the project objectively will be set up.     \nDuring the proposed research project life time we will be also undergoing periodic review in order to keep the project progress on track as well as maintaining its quality up to standard.', '60,602', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/LetterOfEndorsement4.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/ProposedBudget1.xlsx', 130, 255, 'complete', 'yes', 1411249385, 'complete', 'Much of this application is nonsensical, with large chunks of text being repetitious.

(14, 'The principal researcher is a Professor in Food Science and Nutrition and the Founder Editor-in-Chief of AJFAND (African Journal of Food, Agriculture, Nutrition and Development). From 2001 when AJFAND was launched, the inaugural issue was known as African Journal of Food and Nutritional Sciences (AJFNS). The particular issue was then narrowly focused on nutrition. This was going to be mainly a printed version, while providing a soft version as well. However as we headed towards the 3rd issue, a number of challenges had arisen. Noticing a mistake after printing and being unable to correct it is something that always irritates those involved. Web publishing meant that an editorial error could at least be corrected almost instantly. Another major challenge journals face has to do with the cost of sustaining the operations. Well, web publishing at least reduces these costs in absolute terms. \nImmediately eliminated are printing and postage costs. But even more importantly is ability to build up a repository of contacts, and scientists who can be easily grouped in their areas of expertise. Searching for published papers and grouping them according to themes is also doable. Now, we can begin to ask: So what? What can we do with all this published information to help inform policies and programs that address public concerns such as addressing food and nutrition insecurity (hunger, micronutrient deficiencies), food safety, and so on? We can begin to question of what relevance all this information is that we are publishing. There is always pressure on scientists to publish, be they in universities or in research institutions. They always publish so they can build up their resumes for promotion and be able to apply for more grants.\nMany times the scientists overlook the need to include an item for publishing costs in their grant applications. Many times, the scientists do not even link their work with the end targets, be it smallholder farmers, consumers or policy makers. Some 3 years ago, in 2011, Novus International provided AJFAND with US Dollars to keep an intern to tabulate and collate all proximate analysis data. We have that information still. This covers the period since AJFAND went electronic in 2002.  We are aware also that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations uses Food Analysis data that they consider soundly generated in their updating of Food Composition Tables. So there is all this data that is generated across the world through heavily funded research both in fields and in laboratories; a lot of such data sits in documents which have been prepared strictly for donors or scientists’ respective institutions.', 'Potential to influence Programmes and Policies', 'Kenya', 'According to the Call, some of the questions the studies will seek to address include:\n“How do researchers in various institutional contexts practice “openness”? How can open science approaches benefit researchers in the Global South?\nWill OCS lead to novel insights and solutions to entrenched development problems? \nCan greater participation of citizens in the planning and conduct of scientific research increase its application in addressing local development goals?\nHow can the sharing of knowledge as a public good be weighed against protection of various forms of rights”\nWith modern technology and much enhanced communications and data sharing avenues, there is an opportunity to do things differently.  Open Access practice makes data and information more easily available and accessible to potential users; the question is: What difference has it made? This opportunity has and should have huge implications on collaboration and ability to crowd source thematic information from across the world, information that can help in the design of interventions that can positively inform programs and influence policies. \nThe overarching goal of this study is to try and see that better use is made of the data we continuously gather and publish.', 'African Journal of Food, Agriculture and Nutrition (AJFAND) was started in 2001 as a capacity development initiative, to help African scholars  enhance their scientific writing and get their work out there, mentor young scholars:  help them prepare a very first manuscript out of a PhD thesis;  improve writing, editorial and analytical skills as they served as Junior Reviewers. Equally important has been the conscious decision to do something about all the valuable repository of articles we have published, all of which have been archived in various places.  We continue to publish. How can the information be used to positively help humanity?', 'Anticipated Outcomes\nBy the end of the 24 month study, there should be a pattern emerging in the kind of information we have been collecting and publishing, along thematic lines, and the scientists associated with specific topics.  We shall also have some idea as to whether the identified scientists would like to do more with their published data, or indeed what they have already done with it such publication.\nOutputs\n1.

(15, 'The researcher has been designing community practices mediated by Information and Communication Technologies in institutionalized educative context and modelling it from a complex systems and simulation perspective. Has been long time (1996 to the present) activist of Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) and exploring its artifacts and dynamics to empower education and the public (Mayor Office at Bogotá, Colombian Health Ministry) and private sector (Campus Party at Colombia, El Salvador, Brazil, and Spain in1998). He has co-organized several FLOSS community events, like the first FLISoL in Bogotá, that later become the biggest distributed Free Software Festival in Latin America ( http://flisol.info ) , and recently he made  hackathon for citizen oversight of public resources, taught in undergrad and postgraduate institutional context and also at hackerspaces communal context. He is connected with several academic and non-academic institutions and FLOSS communities where he is prototyping and connecting Open Research and Open/Citizen/Garage Science practices and artifacts that include: Open Research self hosted source code repositories, Visual Data Narrartives (VDN), non-linear academic/VDN writing software among others.', 'Bootstrapping and connecting Open/Garage/Citizen Science in Hackerspaces and Open Research Objects in doctoral studies in design and creation', 'Colombia', 'How can we change the digital artifacts that change us? In a world where human affairs are more and more\nmediated by such artifacts, this is a question about empowerment and self-determination both, individual\nand collective.\nThis proposal explores this question from an Open Collaborative Science in the Global South approach in \ntwo senses and spaces:\n\n- It happens in a hacker/maker space of the Global South (Hackbo in Bogotá, Colombia) encouraging and exploring \n  open/garage/citizen science practices throught Visual Data Narratives and self-referential digital artifacts.\n  \n- It happens in the context of a doctoral research in design and creation taken place in a University in the \n  Global South (Univerisity of Caldas, Manizales, Colombia) by using Open Research and Indie Web practices.\n  \nThe next part of the document will expand on this two points, show the connections between this research \nand the thematic areas of OCSD, the theoretical and practical advancements so far since 2010 to the present \nand the connections with Theory of Change, including development outcomes.\n\nAs an Open Research iniciative the inquiry takes part as a doctoral research in design and\ncreation, started in 2010, that has incorporated, since 2011, Open Research (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_research)\nand [Indie Web](http://indiewebcamp.com/) practices, like having a self hosted source code repository of \nall the research, (including this proposal) located at <http://mutabit.com/deltas/repos.fossil/doctorado-offray/> \nand aligned with what, recently, has been coined as [Research Object](http://researchobject.org/) which tries \nto go beyond pdf and writing paper as central elements of research and makes another research objects and \ntheir history visible and auditable.\nBecause research is not on natural sciences, but in design, it is part of the broader field of open research, where\nopen science is located. \nParticulary the research ask for the design and exploration of empowering community dynamics mediated by\ndigital artifacts from the reciprocal modification between them and the communities where they belong. \nThe research also uses for itself the artifacts that proposes and mobilizes for the community where it takes place, \nlike self contained Distributed Version Control Systems (fossil DVCS), or easily learnable and self-referential mutable \nContent Management Systems (web2py) and computer environments for programming and writing of strutured interactive \ndocuments ((pharo/smalltalk)[http://pharo.org/, [Leo Editor](http://leoeditor.com/), \n[IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)).\nIn fact one of the premises is that bridging research, community and hacker/maker practices and artifacts\nis better for all of them.\nThis is also aligned with the ideas of Curating the [Activist Object](http://activistobject.wordpress.com/) in the sense \nthat political forms (in the sense of embeding a power relationship concerning human affairs) are not only taken\nplace in discourses, but also in objects and infrastructures and narratives that we should take into account.\n\nThe key idea about exploring the question about mutual modification of community and digital artifacts is to use the \nproperty of self-refenciality in the last ones, i.e. the fact that digital artifacts can contain a discourse about themselves, \nto make their structure and function explorable and modifiable by the communities where they''re introduced, specifically, \nhacker/maker spaces as disruptive community  operated/oriented places, where this intial exploration can enable new \nopen/garage/citizen science practices.\nVisual Data Narratives (VDN), will be the (meta)medium that boostraps new practices inside this community and with the \nsurrounding environment. \nInternally the idea is to understand better what happens inside a particular hacker/maker space and the knowledge flows \nand practices and externally, to make visible critical dialog with the surrounding environment, particularly government and \nother institutions, about how Information and Communication Technology can help to empower people beyond \nhomogeneous instrumental discourses.\nVDN are a good (meta)medium for this because they use two powerful innate ways to understand and show a complex world: \nvisualization and story telling, and they not only mix worlds, data, algorithms and  visuals but also blur the \ndistinction between document, IDE  (Integrated Development Environment) and the programming language and \nrequire interdisciplinary knowledge to be build more effectively, so by constructing VND a group of diverse people \ncan understand the syntax, sematics and pragmatics of a programming language to talk about the world and once learned\nthat language enables them to build new artifacts to tell new stories.\nVDN are ways that people can use to talk about their concerns, based on evidence and with the possible verification\nof peers, so, in that sense, thy''re connected with the dynamics of Open Science but not only limited to the questions,\ndiscourses and the predominant ways of science, but mainly related with citizen concerns like activism and/or the \noversight of public affairs, among other issues.', 'This research is related with two of the thematic research areas of OCSD:\n\n- (T2) Infrastructures & Technologies: particulary the question on How could knowledge infrastructure be designed to \n  maximize inclusive participation for OCS?\n  because it considers technologies with high potential for moficability, low infrastructure requirements and\n  hightly distributed, so they can be part of a peer to peer dynamics of equals without central points or\n  cyberfeudalism practices enabled by centralized digital infrastructures, but connected throught open standars.\n  Also because the research inquires about the duality participation-reification (Wenger, 1999) and how the\n  reification of (new/mutated) digital artifacts can enable (or not) new forms of participation, using VDN\n  as a medium.\n  \n- (T3) Communities of Practice in Open and Collaborative Science: particulary, the question on \n  How do these pathways challenge conventional norms and structure on the flows of knowledge about science and development, \n  because the research inquires from a open/garage/citizen science perspective that, as I said, asks different questions \n  and happens in different places from those of the intitutional science but can talk with it and enables a different\n  kind of dialogue between Scitific institutions and the broader society, because of the links with academia and other \n  institutional maker/hacker/labs spaces inside institutions, that happen in the context of this research.\n\n  \nSo far the research have advanced in two fronts:\n\n- On the theoretical front a conceptual frame has being build, starting with the idea of self-referential artifacts\n  and reciprocal modification of communities and users and the techno-political discourse of the hacker/maker \n  culture that takes form in doing with code artifacts, spaces and other creations (Coleman, 2013, Sennett 2009).\n  Theoretical references has beeing reviewed about self-referentiality: Wolfgang Jonas and his epistemology of design,\n  based on autopoietic systems from Maturana, Varela and Luhman and the critics to the last one by Fuchs and Hofkirchner\n  in their critical social systems theory. \n  This theoretical framework can be connected with Theory of Change \n  and its idea of a transparent (re)distribution of power but can also be assumed from a non-linear complex systems\n  perspective with feedback cycles, holoptic infrastructures (Bauwens), internal evalution and self-directed modification.\n\n- On the practical front, besides infrastructures and practices for Open Research already in place, HackBo, the local \n  hackerspace has been inhabited, since its beginning in 2010, reviewing, designing and participating in several \n  activities, seeing the dynamics and motivations of the people and the relationships between several communities\n  of practice inside the space and their artifacts. \n  Their domains cover different themes like designing and making crowdfunding campaigns, cryptography and privacy,\n  hacktivism and citizen empowerment, programming workshops, web infrastructures, Internet governance or citizen\n  organized hackathons for a more auditable and transparent goverment. Some of them happen in articulation with\n  global initiatives.\n  \nDespite the relative flat and transitory hierarchies, there are still barriers of participation, mainly for novices\nand people with different interest to the already enumerated.\nThe big potential of the hacker/maker ways of doing your self, doing it together and doing it with others (DYI, DIT, DIWO) \nis not only on the artifacts but in the dynamics that enable the shared building of solutions, like an online\nencyclopedia of hundreds of thousands of editors, an operative system kernel of thousands of programmers or hundreds\nof small community places run by local communities with almost no hierarchy.\nThe general population can be a beneficiary of new ways of doing together, particularly in what concerns with\nopen, garage and citizen science in a dialogue with more orthodox ways of making science and citizen participation.\n\nThe research or activity will add value to existing knowledge and/or practice, by extending and articulating \nthe previous practice in hacker/maker spaces in research outcomes and designing and characterizing a two ways of reciprocal influence between hacker/maker practices and research practices  :\n\n- By using hacker/maker and indie web practices and artifacts to build Open Research Objects for OCS (mainly DVCS)\n- By reading, (re)designing an intervening, from a research perspective, hacker/maker practices and artifacts to create more self awareness inside community and improving the relationships with the surrounding environment (mainly government and academia).', '- The doctoral thesis as a Open Research object, with a qualitative and quantitative model of the reciprocal\n  modification of communities and digital artifacts.\n  The quantitative approach expects to be build on mapping the modifications of source code repositories, \n  infrastructures and artifacts and their authors/maintainers.\n  The qualitative approach expects to be build as a description of motivations and interactions between\n  participants in the hacker/maker space and the effect of VDN inside and outside the space.\n  Both of them expect to dialog with Theory of Change as an approach to design, evaluate, build consensus,\n  construct in the divergence and also to put ToC in the context of non-linear community dynamics.\n\n- A digital artifact for the writing of visual data narratives and research papers, from an outliner tree-like\n  non-linear writing metaphor, that integrates the scholarly Markdown, pandoc, yaml, CSL and Zotero. \n  There is already a description of this process on my own writing at: http://bit.ly/1owVIc8 and also a \n  pharo/smalltalk new prototype under a MIT open knowledge license at: http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~Offray/Ubakye/\n  \n- Visual data narratives workshops with documentation and artifacts covered by Open Knowledge Definition compatible\n  licenses and aligned with was has been explored on the Indie Web Science workshops.\n  \n- Articulation with national and international networks and collectives of open science, citizen oversight, freedom\n  of expression and net neutrality throught several events like hackathons, workshops and barcamps.\n  For this we will try to stretch relationships with the local Karisma Foundation to disseminate results to different stake holders\n  beyond local community at the hackerspace. \n  Karisma Foundation has build long lasting relationships with EFF, Mozilla Foundation, p2p Foundation, LatinAmerican Foundation \n  for the Freedom of the Press (Flip) among others\n  The researcher is member of  local communities, like the [HackBo hackerspace](http://hackbo.co),\n  [RedPaTodos](http://redpatodos.co/), a civic organization for the defense of rights on Internet, and he is starting an informal dialogue between \n  practices at HackBo as a community operated space and hacker/maker/fab/living labs and spaces inside Universities and Libraries in \n  Bogotá, Colombia, among other people at TadeoLab (Tadeo University), ViveLab (National University of Colombia), Atico (Javeriana University) and  \n  plataforma (Luis Angel Arango National Library).\n  Also mutabiT will be mobilizing this ideas in several events and collectives.\n  \nThis outcomes are an extension and consolidation of the already ongoing theorethical and practical field research,\nusing the OCSDnet grant to empower artifacts, comprenhensions, networks and practices already depicted.\nThe beneficiaries will be the grant recipient and the community where research happens as this will be used to cover \nthis dual (community and institutional) Open Research/Science project, by building and completing artifacts for \nthis research, helping with economical struggling of the hackerspace, giving infrastructure to become a seeing hacker/maker space (see Bret Victor video\nand comic on Seeing Spaces at: http://worrydream.com/SeeingSpaces/) and enabling new relatioships and dialogues\nwith government, labs/spaces inside academia, through evens like hackathons, barcamps, etc.', 'The inquiry for the artifacts and community relationship will be about the duality on reification/participation on how new practices are creating/incorporating digital artifacts that, reciprocally empower/modify that practices? and how this practices/artifacts make sense in the community?\n\nThe negotiation and dialogue with the community will be inspired by ToC methodologies, where participants of workshops and new practices will establish desired outcomes from the

That same year the inaugural Caribbean Laureate also earned the Boehrigher Ingleheim Award for Hypertension Research in Developing Countries. Professor Forrester (BSc, MSc, PhD, DM) unified four research units across three UWI campuses when he spearheaded the formation of the Tropical Medical Research Institute, which merged the Tropical Metabolism Research Unit, the Sickle Cell Research Unit and the Epidemiology Research Unit at UWI Mona, and the Chronic Disease Research Unit in Barbados. Forrester, who has served as an adviser to a number of international health organizations, including the World Health Organization, the Medical Research Council (UK) and the United States Center for Disease Control, has focused in his research on the causes of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. This work has been especially significant in the Caribbean context, given the region’s prevalence of hypertension and high death rate from coronary heart disease.\n\nProf Forrester''s work is being extended to other developing contexts through the establishment of UWI Solutions for Developing Countries (SODECO), a new research entity headquartered on the UWI Mona Campus. UWI SODECO focuses on the global explosion of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Its primary research goal in medicine is discovery of previously unidentified mechanisms that lead to obesity and the cardio-metabolic diseases especially those pathways to disease that can inform novel treatments and preventive strategies.', 'Enabling a Global Collaborative Medical Science Research Network using Open ICTs', 'Jamaica, Ghana, The Gambia, South Africa', 'Problem Definition\nUWI Solutions for Developing Countries (UWI SODECO) is one node in an international network of research institutions that share a focus on one question of global importance: What mechanisms underlie the global epidemic of obesity and its comorbid cardiovascular diseases, and how can discovery of such mechanism inform effective prevention and treatment? SODECO is invested in a sub question: Why is this phenomenon so much worse in populations (China, India, Sub Saharan Africa) that have been undernourished for generations? \nAll research carried out within the network is of the highest quality as evidenced by support from funding agencies such as the US National Institutes of Health and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\nA Global research network of 12 actively participating institutions (located in Jamaica, US, UK, New Zealand, Australia,  South Africa, Ghana, The Gambia) has been established to better tackle aspects of this massive question. \n\nEach node of this research network brings an experimental scientific resource, specific skill set and competence portfolio that contributes to tackling this question as a network.  The activities of the network which deliver on the research questions include:\n• Collaborative meetings and consultations\n• Collaborative visits of academic and technical staff\n• Shared standards of collection, storage, management and exploitation of research data\n\nHowever the efficacy of the network, and it’s ultimate productivity is constrained by the absence of a shared collaborative platform that will allow and facilitate the effective coordination of network activities and researcher interaction across time and space. For the moment the real productive collaborative consultations occurs sporadically during physical visits between collaborators and the expense involved in convening multiple partners is prohibitive. The mentorship and development of the next generation of researchers is hampered by inadequate sustained contact with colleagues across the network.\n\nResearch Objectives / Questions\nWhile a variety of communications and collaborative tools currently exist, including low-cost platforms such as skype,  google hangout, web-conferencing platforms, the dynamics of this global medical research network creates idiosyncratic requirements, such as:\n• Synchronised data capture and management: the need to harmonize data collection activities in multiple jurisdictions, such that common instruments can be designed and administered across the network; data can be collected, validated and made available to researchers in relatively short review cycles.\n• Shared protocols for data exploitation and archiving: Research Data is the currency of this network and needs to be accessible to researchers across the network, while observing the appropriate protocols for privacy, security and integrity. Data lineage, retention and archival also needs to be carefully managed as medical research of this nature is typically long-lived, multi-year, across multiple cohorts \n• Shared approaches to translating data to information and information to product: Researchers across the network bring a variety of skill-sets in terms of data analysis, interpretation and the creation of research artifacts for disseminating knowledge to  both the scientific and non-scientific communities. \n• Face to face meetings in virtual space: Regular researcher interactions and collaborations are greatly enhanced by a virtual space that supports voice, video and media-sharing while allowing on-demand access to network data resources and knowledge content\n\nThis research proposal is situated in the OCSD Research theme 2 (T2): Infrastructures & Technologies and will seek to conceptualize and engineer an integrated, collaborative networked space that can enable and empower the effective coordination of this global medical research network. The design constraints on the collaborative network include the use of accessible open technologies that account for inequities in connectivity, access to the technologies and technical resource base across the jurisdictions covered by the research initiative. \nResearch Questions relevant to this include:\n• What are some of the limitations, tensions, and problems associated with infrastructure provisioning especially across heterogeneous contexts with varied technological resources & capabilities?\n• How to ensure technical, social, and institutional interoperability when implementing OCS projects?\n• How could knowledge infrastructure be designed to maximize inclusive participation for OCS?\n\nWhile theme 2 is the dominant focus, other relevant questions relate to Theme 3 (T3): Communities of Practice in Open and Collaborative Science, including:\n• How does improved access and use of shared data from heterogeneous contexts across the global network enhance the research processes and make new questions thinkable?\n• Does the open collaborative space change the ways that new knowledge is generated, learned, shared and communicated?\n• Can open networked ICTs challenge conventional norms and structure on the flows of knowledge about science and development?', 'This research will use a design science approach to conceptualize and engineer an integrated, collaborative networked space that can enable and empower the effective coordination of this global medical research network, while addressing the unique challenges and idiosyncratic requirements highlighted earlier. According to the prescriptive guidelines offered by (Hevner et al. 2004), Design Science Research is motivated by problem solving and is geared towards the building, evaluation and application of innovative, purposeful ICT artifacts that can address practical business needs. \n\nKey guidelines in this methodological approach that will apply to this initiative include:\nDesign as an Artifact: Design-science research must produce a viable artifact in the form of a construct, a model, a method or an instantiation. \nThe specific ICT artifacts to be developed through this project include:  \n•A Data Collection platform that can integrate and synchronize the design and administration of web-, mobile- and paper form-based  data collection activities across widespread geographic contexts\n• Data management / Data as a Service platform that can deliver research data on demand to research investigators, analysts and expert practitioners while preserving the requisite privacy and security constraints\n• Web-based conferencing and collaboration platform that integrates text, voice and video communications around a shared media space\nThese capabilities will be integrated from existing open source components including tools such as ODKCollect for mobile data collection, Formhub server for forms design/delivery-based, Data virtualization tools and Open conferencing platforms (eg. BigBlueButton) \nProblem Relevance: The objective of design science research is to develop technology-based solutions to important and relevant  developmental and business problems  \nThe challenges associated with coordinating this global research medical network goes well beyond the individual capabilities of popular communications tools such as skype,  google hangout, etc. The dynamics of this global medical research network creates idiosyncratic requirements which include:\n• Synchronised data capture and management on a global scale\n• Shared protocols for data exploitation and archiving \n• Shared approaches to translating data to information and information to product \n• Face to face meetings in virtual space\nThese challenges limit the efficiency and effectiveness with which research endeavour can be coordinated and research knowledge and information can be shared and exchanged on a global scale across technologically heterogeneous contexts, while integrating into the knowledge discovery and learning process.\nDesign Evaluation: The utility, quality and efficacy of a design artifact must be rigorously demonstrated via well executed evaluation methods.  \nThis research project incorporates both design work and practical Implementation activities as the ICT artifacts derived from this initiative will be deployed and evaluated in a real-world context. Evaluation will include both the technical efficacy of the integrated platform as well as the impact on the individual, group and process dynamics of an existing community of practice, especially given the heterogeneous contexts across the global network \nResearch Contribution:  Effective design science must provide clear and verifiable contributions in the areas of the design artifact, design foundations, and or design methodologies.  \nThe research contribution of this project occurs on two layers:\ni.  A real-world case evaluation of the challenges, tensions, and problems associated with  open collaborative network infrastructure  provisioning especially across heterogeneous contexts with varied technological resources & capabilities\nii. An effective solution artefact will help to advance the existing research endeavour on a major development concern of global importance in the Health domain, and will be re-usable in other similar global research domains\n\nOCSDNet Relevance\nSeveral aspects of this methodological approach resonates with the OCSDNet ideal:\nIt is situated in a real-world Global South research setting that is by design, collaborative with the goal of facilitating knowledge exchange and shared learning, while addressing an important global health problem. It employs open networked ICTs that can be deployed across technologically heterogamous contexts. Because it is being applied in an ongoing multi-year research context, it will have the opportunity to evaluate the impact  of the OCS intervention on an existing communities of practitioners and stakeholders and their behaviours, contexts, challenges and opportunities.', 'Expected  outcomes from the project are:\n- An integrated, networked collaboration infrastructure solution that can enable and empower the effective coordination of this global medical research network. This will be integrated from existing open source components and will be therefore available for re-use across other scientific contexts\n- A real-world case evaluation of the challenges, tensions, and problems associated with  open collaborative network infrastructure provisioning especially across heterogeneous contexts with varied technological resources & capabilities\n- Insights and lessons learned about how to ensure technical, social, and institutional interoperability when implementing OCS projects; and how knowledge infrastructure can be designed to maximize inclusive participation, and peer-to-peer knowledge exchange and learning across developing contexts\n- Other tangible deliverables include target user surveys, training workshops and dissemination/stakeholder forums\n\nIn addition to the desired research outcomes from the OCS project, the initiative is expected to have a positive impact on the wider research setting that it was designed to support. Specifically, for the global medical science research network, an effective deployment should realize the following outcomes / impact:\n- Enhance the effective coordination of network activities and researcher interaction across time and space. \n- Support productive virtual collaborative consultations thus reducing the need and prohibitive expense of physical visits between collaborators and when convening multiple partners. \n- Provide a medium for active mentorship, development and knowledge share of the next generation of researchers by the more experience researchers and practitioners within the network.\n- Enable more effective access, sharing and analysis outcomes of data from globally dispersed developing contexts, in order to maximize the value and use of research data which is the primary currency of this network.\n- Effective outcomes could positively impact institutional policy posture as it relates to research data collection and sharing, especially within this network of 12 research partner institutions\n\nThese outcomes resonate with the some of the key goals and objectives of the OCSDNet including the following:\n• Evaluating open and collaborative approaches to knowledge production that have the potential to increase the visibility, validation and relevance of scientific research, and expanding the opportunities for a broad range of actors to participate in the knowledge production process.\n• Enabling communities of open science practitioners and researchers in different contexts, through interactive research networks.', 'Specific to the Design Science methodology, formal evaluation methods will be established to rigorously assess and demonstrate the quality and efficacy of the design artifact. The evaluation methods will be of two types as prescribed by (Hevner et al. 2004):\n\nAnalytical: Given the proposed integration of various open source components, the functions and performance of the designed artefact(s) will be evaluated in a test environment against the desired functionality prescribed for the problem domain\n\nObservational Case Study: The designed artifact will be deployed and evaluated in the real-world setting of the medical sciences research network. This evaluation will include observations and measurement of the use and performance of the networked platform, as well as surveys of the users. \n\nBeyond the evaluation of the design artifact, we will also employ a formal Outcome Mapping Methodology (OMM) to ensure that the overall design process is driven by the active engagement and needs of the key stakeholder participants in the target case research network, and in the actual participatory evaluation and validation of the outcomes. This evaluation will assess the impact of the technology intervention on the individual, group and process dynamics of the existing community of practice, especially given the heterogeneous contexts across the global network.', 'CA $ $77,012.18', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/SODECO_ENDORSEMENT.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudgetTemplate_-_SODECO4.xlsx', 82, 255, 'complete', 'yes', 1411250003, 'complete', 'This project seems to be about the evaluation and acquisition of tools, but many of these already exist, as the applicants say themselves.

Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a climate-dependent mosquito-borne arboviral infection belonging to the Phlebovirus genus of the Bunyaviridae family. The virus uses vectors such as mosquitoes for infection transfer to livestock and humans (Bishop & Beaty, 1988). Since its first description in 1930 in Kenya (Daubney et al., 1931; Davies, 1975), the virus has been recurring occasionally as epidemic disease in nearly all of Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa, Arabian Peninsula and Madagascar (Meegan et al., 1978; Mohamed et al., 2010) posing threat to Europe (Chevalier, 2013). In East Africa, RVF epidemics are known to be associated with unusual heavy rainfall patterns (Soti et al., 2012). RVFV is passed from generation to generation of Aedine mosquitoes trans-ovarially (Logan et al., 1991; Diallo et al., 2000; Romoser et al., 2011). This vertical disease transmission provides the virus with a sustainable mechanism of existence because eggs can survive for several years in dry conditions (Logan et al., 1991; Nguku et al., 2010; Linthicum et al., 1999; Gerdes, 2002) Rainfall and temperature play a major role in determining the emergence of the infected mosquito populations and the amplification of the virus (Soti et al., 2012; Anyamba et al., 2010; Linthicum et al., 2007; Pin-Diop et al., 2007). \n\nIn this study, we will attempt to use mosquito distribution information and ecological niche models to assess risk of emergence and re-emergence of potential Rift Valley Fever epidemic hotspots in combination using future scenario environmental-climatic factors such as temperature, precipitation, elevation and derived-normalized difference vegetation index. Ecological niche models (ENM) such as  Maximum Entropy Species Distribution Modeling (Maxent) and Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) will be used for predicting and discovering areas of undocumented species’ habitats, which in turn could be useful for planners in creating disease surveillance programs and mosquito control strategies. This new technology can supplement and help improve existing surveillance programs by describing, in a spatially explicitly way, suitable habitats for mosquito species(Larson et al., 2010).\n\nRationale\nIn Tanzania, there is inadequate information on Rift Valley Fever outbreak in relation to on the ground ecological factors such as vectors responsible and distribution as well as its linkages with local environmental and climatic patterns. Few studies have already been done to identify potential areas about RVF transmission in relation to entomological and ecological factors are concerned. There is a need to conduct such studies to establish to identify transmission risk area and vector ecological habitat preference. Results from this study will help future surveillance efforts in geographic areas with large populations of potential RVF outbreak in human, domestic animal, and wildlife hosts and contribute considerably when implementing future disease control programs.\n\nBroad Objective\nTo assessed the impact of future climate scenarios on variability of habitat suitability as emerging RVF hotspots in Tanzania\n\nSpecific Objectives \n1. To identify geo-ecological distribution of mosquito vectors in relation to RVF outbreak hotspots in Tanzania \n2. To identify important environmental and climatic variables associated with distribution of RVF vectors\n3. To develop an ecological niche models for habitat suitability of mosquito species responsible for RVF transmission in the current and future climate scenarios\n4. To identify emerging and re-emerging RVF epidemic hotspots based on climatic scenario map thresholding', 'Current species occurrence data will be driven from entomological fieldwork in Ngorongoro District in northern Tanzania.

Chronic food insecurity and hunger are severe common problems in Mid and Far Western region of Nepal. Half of the under-five children suffer from stunting, 13 % suffer from wasting, and 39% are underweight. The nutrition and food security situation in Nepal is far from satisfactory. According to the World Bank an estimated 2-3 % of the country''s GDP (US$ 250 to 375 million) is lost every year on account of vitamin and mineral deficiencies alone. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS 2011), chronic energy deficiency in women (as measured in body mass index – BMI) remains at 18.2 % and the prevalence of low birth weight is estimated at 12.4 %. Two out of every five (41%) children under five are stunted or chronically malnourished and a third (29 %) is underweight. Wasting, which reflects more short-term under-nutrition currently stands at 11 %.  With a global hunger index of 19.9, which is considered a serious level, addressing food security remains a high priority for Nepal. \n\nSocio-economic, geographic, and environmental factors all contribute to the food insecurity and poor nutritional status of Nepalese. Even with about two-third of the population being engaged in agriculture, domestic production is barely adequate to meet the increasing needs of the population. The general reasons and factors responsible for this situation are insufficient production of foods, lack of road for transportation (physical remoteness) of foods and goods, poor access to market, high postharvest loss of food grains, fruits, vegetables by insects and environmental factors, lack of scientific knowledge and skill for storage and preservation of food to reduce postharvest loss, unawareness about science of nutrition, food habit and preference, underutilization of certain local food crops including wild type, unawareness and ignorance in personal hygiene and sanitation, unaccess to potable drinking water, spread of diarhhroea like epidemic diseases, natural disasters like flood and landslide and poverty or poor purchasing power. Postharvest loss as elsewhere in the developing countries is very high (30-40%) in Nepal. \n\nThe Nutrition Assessment and Gap Analysis (NAGA) in 2009 outlined the multi-sectoral determinants of malnutrition in Nepal, and called for a multi-sectoral approach to tackling this problem. With the leadership of National Planning Commission and partners, multi-sectoral nutrition plan (2013-2017) has been formally launched and there are emerging needs to implement the plan with the support from all partners and stakeholders. \n\nNepal, basically is an agricultural prone country comprising with 75 districts ranging from very high altitudes of mountains in the lap of Himalaya to very low altitudes (below 1000 ft from sea level) of highly fertile land. But the productivity of the food stuff (both vegetable based and animal based) varies from place to place depending upon rainfall, topography, food production technique and climatic condition. Further, the availability of the food has been affected heavily due to many factors especially in the hilly areas like lack of proper food storage, ignorance in processing and storage techniques, less importance given by public as well as by private sectors upon rational of proper storage and improper distribution of foods due to worse transportation network. The situation is even worse in far-western and mid-western districts. Out of 24 districts of these regions, two districts Kalikot and Jajarkot in mid-western region seem appropriate districts for the study. As these two districts are the part of remote areas which are most food deficit and insecure districts, have low access but considerable population pressures. By agricultural production, almost all common cereals, legumes, fruits, vegetables and animal products are produced. The research questions are therefore investigating the magnitude of loss of locally grown and available foods, finding innovative scientific ways to reducing these postharvest food losses, assessing the implications of food processing knowhow on nutritional and health status of the local people especially the vulnerable groups of women (mothers) and under five years children.  \n\nSince Kalikot and Jajarkot have similarities with many districts in socio-economical, socio-cultural, and geographical conditions the selection of these two districts for this study project is further justifiable. Proper postharvest management technology is powerful tool to reduce postharvest food loss and design food products of desired nutritional quality. By proper storage of food, application of food preservation technologies and processing of food catering to nutritional requirement of needy people combined with good hygiene, sanitation and pertinent education situation of food security can be significantly improved.', 'Sampling plan\nFor this research, a well established 30 cluster systematic sampling approach will be adopted from both districts based on number of households. Total number of sample size will be 30 cluster x 7 samples from each cluster making 210 total samples (for assessment and evaluation purposes). The sample means a house hold. Base on the data of 2010, total number of house hold in Kalikot is 18487 while in Jajarkot is 24147 making a total of 42634 households in both districts. Hence, 210 households will be taken randomly from 42634 households.\n\nBy weightage method, 91 households will be taken as sample from Kalikot district and 119 households will be taken from Jajarkot. Therefore in total the sample size will be 210 households. \n\nFurther, the number of households will be taken from each district based on number of VDCs so that at least some samples are represented at least from VDCs having well established population settlements. The VDCs having well settlement will be selected from population map of the districts. Similarly, number of households from VDC also will be based on weightage of no. of household in each VDC. \n\nMethodology\nThe proposed methodologies are outlined as below. \n• Base-line data of food security and nutrition will be established in targeted project area.\n• Assessment the magnitude of postharvest food loss and factors associated.\n• Assessment the knowledge and skill of local people on food preservation, nutrition and utilization of locally available foods in community.\n• Analysis of nutritional value of local raw materials and newly developed processed food products.\n• Development of palatable, nutritious food products from locally produced food crops to meet the nutritional requirement of women and under five children.\n• Development and demonstration of need driven innovative socio-economically feasible food storage and preservation technologies. \n• Study of effect of feeding newly developed nutritious processed food products on the health and nutritional status of women and children.\n• Different Anthropometric measurement will be carried out throughout nutritional survey. \n• Before-and – after without control design method under Informal experimental designs will be applied for nutritional survey to assess the nutritional status of mother and children under five years of age. \n• Education of women and locals about the nutritional benefit of the newly developed processed food products using community health volunteers.\n• Research and development of innovative post harvest technology will be carried out with collaborators. \n• Dissemination of developed innovative post harvest technology to local people for self use and income generation purpose. \n• Education and awareness on hygiene and sanitation.\n• Regular monitoring and evaluation framework will be developed. \n• A dissemination workshop will be organized at the end of project participating donor, government representatives, community people, relevant stakeholders and media. \n• Major findings and outcomes will be published in website. \n\nBased on scientific research of the project, the findings will be shared with local community and relevant stakeholders as well as exchange of experience in international forum. The research project will strengthen the collaboration among the research institution, local NGOs, Academic Institutions, Government Agencies and Development Partners. Innovative idea in post harvest technology will be explored to address burning issues of food insecurity in Nepal.', 'The expected study outcomes are as following.\n• Assessment of magnitude of postharvest food loss and factors associated are completed\n• Increased nutritional awareness in women and mothers resulting in better health care and nutritional status of children and family. This eventually benefits the whole community.\n• Increased knowledge and skill for reducing postharvest losses of food due to the education provided in principle and technique of food storage and preservation, and knowledge in newer food preservation technologies. The food which is not lost is the same as the food which is created. This leads to improved availability and accessibility of food and nutrients in the target community and region. \n• Women (mothers) and small children have nutritionally improved health status\n• Improved hygiene and sanitation is achieved which in turn contributes to increased utilization of nutrients important for food security\n• Millennium Development Goals (eradicate hunger, improve maternal health and women empowerment, reduce child mortality) are met\n• Improved income, employment and living standard through access to food processing technologies. The technology knowhow develops entrepreneurship which in turn improves economic condition of the whole community and hence this improves its accessibility to food and nutrients\n• Due to the introduction of innovative processing technologies the food consumption pattern of the community in context is diversified thus utilizing yet underutilized local food crops\n• This action research becomes replicable in other districts with similar socio-economic and geographic conditions\n\nThe present project objectives are in line with UN Declaration which advocates right to a standard of living, adequate for the health and well being of the individual and his family since standards of living are ascertained by safe, sound and wholesome food in adequate quantities.

His experience with open science and open access research will add to the expertise in this project.', 'Strengthening OCS research by studying the institutional mechanisms and motivations of traditional, open knowledge systems in India', 'India', 'It has been acknowledged for several decades through studies that Traditional Knowledge (TK) systems in science and society are used widely in developing countries, especially in India. The benefits of TK systems are amplified because this knowledge is available freely to the public as an open access resource. Several academic efforts have detailed the significance of TK systems for scientific research, especially in identifying sustainable solutions for the needs of vast sections of people and not just ones who can afford them. In India particularly, TK systems continue to be practiced by the poor as a survival strategy where this knowledge operates in a socio-ecological system with benefits accruing in various sectors including healthcare, agriculture, forestry and craft based livelihoods.\n\nThe practice of TK in India is not restricted to lay practitioners but also academics and others who have validated the efficacy of TK systems. The health implications of ethno-medical plant resources as practiced by the peoples of several parts of the country have been documented (i). The methods of conserving and sustaining biodiversity by traditional communities in several agro-ecological zones, including the coastal and hilly terrains by the local communities are also widely acknowledged (ii) . Further, regional governments have developed institutions to build upon these TK systems to develop and adapt solutions for different needs. Today some of the TK have found a ready relevance in the modern market space for themselves as well (iii). \n\nTK systems offer learning tools and opportunities to open and collaborative science (OCS) because:\n(1) The knowledge of the processes of production in TK systems are publicly available \n(2) TK systems thrive on a culture of sharing and collaborations among various stake holders \n(3) TK systems address critical, long term development challenges particularly in the context of the climate change resilience \n(4) TK systems are socially inclusive\n\nIn this project, we will explain how the roles of the practitioners of TK systems, their approaches to planning to handle development challenges and the institutions through which they share knowledge openly, provides valuable inputs to the development of OCS in India and the global South. We employ the case study approach to explore specific instances where traditional, community based knowledge systems have been researched, documented and made available in the public domain as open access resources to further the cause of collaborative research. We develop the case for learning in OCS based on the TK systems in India by studying the following examples: \n\n(1) The use of Nilavembu Kashayam (Botanical name: Andrographispaniculata),a herbal concoction based on the Siddha and Ayurvedic systems of knowledge, by the State Government of Tamil Nadu to tackle a dengue epidemic in the region in 2012 \n(2) The utility of an easy-to-use chromatogram kit developed by the Shri AMM MurugappaChettiar Research Centre (MCRC) in Tamil Nadu, which was developed by Ehrenfried Pfeiffer (iv)  as part of the principles of biodynamic farming that could assist farmers to determine the soil fertility of fields in the region\n(3) The marketing of natural dyes developed by the Natural Dyes Research and Training Centre of Gandhigram Trust in Tamil Nadu which are not only effective and durable but are also environment friendly unlike other chemical dyes \n(4) The agricultural System of Rice Intensification developed in Madagascar but adopted large scale in India which is a set of processes for growing rice with reduced amounts of water and devoid of chemical inputs while offering the same or more levels of output as compared to other high input methods of production\n\nThrough these cases we will demonstrate that TK systems provide learning opportunities for OCS, specifically:\n(1) Motivational factors: What can OCS researchers learn from the sharing of TK in the public domain without any individual gains for the practitioners of TK? What insights does this provide into examining the motivations for adopting OCS approaches in doing research?\n(2) Procedural & environmental factors: Can understanding the socio-cultural conditions in which TK practitioners developed processes akin to OCS help create similar pro-open environments for OCS researchers to develop and share knowledge openly?\n(3) Value based factors: Why do TK systems attach less economic value but more intrinsic value to the process of community learning and sharing? Can these drivers of the value behind TK systems help capture and measure the value of OCS?\n\nReferences:\ni. http://envis.frlht.org/indian-medicinal-plants-database.php\nii. https://www.cbd.int/financial/bensharing/india-abs.pdf\niii. http://cgmedplants.in/highlights/herbal-chhattisgarh\niv. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrenfried_Pfeiffer', 'This research project will use a qualitative approach to explore the motivations and conditions under which Traditional Knowledge (TK) systems have flourished in an open and collaborative manner in India. The research design involves:\n\nLiterature Review: The study begins with a review of relevant literature from academic journals, magazines and references from traditional texts from India. This will provide insights on the importance of TK systems, particularly in health, natural resource management and community learning. This understanding will also offer inputs on how TK systems address emerging development challenges and the scope it offers for strengthening the practice of Open and Collaborative Science (OCS). Further, the literature review will help identify (a) gaps between the practice of OCS (b) opportunities for learning from the practice of TK systems in India (c) learning from the institutional mechanisms which have contributed to some successful instances for the adaptation of TK systems in mainstream scientific research and implementation. These findings can help feed into the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework for identifying factors to strengthen OCS in the global South, especially India\n\nInterviews: To strengthen the findings from the literature review, the research will gather specific details from eminent persons from the sectors in which the case studies are situated. The interviews will be conducted with lay practitioners, government personnel, scientists, civil society organizations and research organizations. The interviews will help in identifying the strengths (and weaknesses) of TK systems and ways in which they can be adopted to better facilitate an open and collaborative environment for conducting research in India.\n\nCase studies: The research study will incorporate the following qualitative case studies.\na) Healthcare: In 2012, the state of Tamil Nadu in India saw a dengue epidemic in several areas. The government acted rapidly on the advice of practitioners of traditional medical knowledge systems such as Siddha and Ayurveda to develop herbal concoctions such as “Nilavembu Kashayam”. This combined with other response protocols helped control the vector borne disease, dengue. Further, clinical trials on the effects of “Nilavembu Kashayam” have shown it to have reliable anti-viral properties.\n\nb) Soil fertility: In the system of biodynamic farming chromatography is used to show the requirements of nutrients in the soil. Using knowledge of soil fertility and cost effective chromatography, research institutions have developed an easy-to-use kit to reliably determine soil nutrient requirements and advise farmers accordingly. The principles of traditional biodynamic farming which are available in the open domain have thus led to collaborative research in aiding farmers provide the right nutrients to the soil in their field. The chromatography techniques were lying in the open domain for almost a century before MCRC began to standardise it. In the current technique the more information is gained through the testing system the more robust becomes the image processing technology that powers it.\n\nc) Developing natural dyes: The Natural Dyes Research and Training Centre in Gandhigram, Tamil Nadu has successfully developed natural dyes which are environment friendly and effective. Dyes manufactured in the Centre have been developed based on the indigenous knowledge available in the community and – thus providing sustainability to environment and people’s livelihoods.\n\nd) System of Rice Intensification (SRI): This case looks at an innovation in agro-food systems, SRI, which has spread widely in India and across the world, largely because farmers and those involved in its promotion exchanged the innovation process through open sourcing. This case will highlight the role of networks, the potential of open sourcing and the imperative to provide spaces for communities to enhance their innovative capacity.\n\nThe above case studies will analyze the following factors through an approach derived from the IAD framework:\ni) What was the developmental challenge addressed by the case? \nii) What were the incentives for the actors to collaborate and develop an open solution?\niii) What were the socio-cultural contexts under which the TK based solutions emerged?\niv) What were the institutional designs and mechanisms by which the TK practitioners and other external actors collaborated in developing an open solution for the challenge? \n\nBased on these individual case findings, the research will attempt to link the different actors, contexts and mechanisms for understanding the framework in which TK systems operate as an open and collaborative framework. This will offer broad lessons for OCS to be conceptualized and explained in a context relevant to the global South and significant for local communities and challenges.', 'The primary outcome of this research project is for larger groups of citizens to understand the benefits of participating in open and collaborative science (OCS) research. Reports indicate a large prevalence of the TK in various sectors, for instance the Healthcare sector has usage of over 70% (1) of the Indian population reaching out to it for its primary healthcare, yet so little is known on this open knowledge source, its protocols, methods of research or propagation. The case studies based on Traditional Knowledge (TK) systems used in this project relate to everyday practices which have captured the attention of the scientific community and civil society groups in India.  It will indicate the salient features and thereby roadmaps for a large scale adoption of OCS in public policy using TK practices and systems. \n\nThe project will also create awareness on how effective solutions to several developmental challenges have been addressed through research based on TK systems available in the open domain. In the process, it will highlight some of the features of the OCS processes of the TK domain and create templates. These templates utilizing TK solutions, which have been validated by even the modern scientific processes and research institutions, will provide roadmaps for similar adoption of systems in public domain both by the government and non-government sectors. Therefore, a greater enthusiasm on developing cost-effective solutions using open science and TK systems is expected through this project.\n\nWhile market pull based domain specific research from TK has often been initiated and sustained as proprietary research for patenting and individual benefits, the OCS based research on TK that has relevance for larger mass and is fundamentally research for a public cause has not been seen or presented as an ‘open source research’. This study hopes that more researchers and practitioners of OCS and TK systems will contribute to expanding the base of knowledge with alternate forms of knowing, learning and doing science. Exploring these alternative approaches to knowledge production will contribute to greater opportunities for collaboration in significant areas of scientific research. Thus, this project is expected to set the stage for the creation of a community of OCS practitioners from among civil society groups, scientists and lay practitioners. \n\nThis project is also expected to identify factors that can strengthen the case of OCS in the science and technology policy framework of India, given its interest in identifying open access solutions based on TK systems. These factors will include institutional mechanisms, key actors and processes which will drive the case for OCS in India.\n\nReferences:\n(1) http://www.scidev.net/global/disease/feature/integrating-modern-and-traditional-medicine-facts-and-figures.html', 'The project objective will be accomplished by eliciting feedback from former and current members of the scientific establishments in the country.

The involvement as consultant for different International organization such as FAO, WHO, UN/ESCAP, UNIDO and various national  organization  will benefit not only for  preparing strategy but also for the disseminating the outcomes and appropriate policy development  to tackle the impact of  climate change on food safety.', 'Climate change and its impact on food safety in Nepal: food contaminants (Microbes, mycotoxins and pesticide residue)', 'NEPAL', 'Climate change is one of the most serious issues facing by the planet. The general concern of climate change is it affects agricultural production, crop yield, food security, etc but concern should also be on towards its impact on food safety as result of abiotic stress, emerging pathogens, enhanced ability of fungi to develop and produce mycotoxins; increased use of pesticide and decreased water availability influencing the safety and quality of foods. Due to the lack of good models, observational data and available scenarios, the relationship between climate change and food safety is difficult to establish. So this project’s objective is to find out the relation of climate change and food safety.\n\nThe extremities of weather events in Nepal where most of the people engage in smallholder farming are expected to be affected most. As result of climate shift, development and spread of crop diseases, pests and weeds have already shown adverse impact on agriculture, human health and environment. The extreme precipitation, storms and floods are the frequently occurring events in Nepal and at same time some part face drought. These are the factors which make favorable for fungal growth. So the contamination risk of mycotoxin producing fungi at this moment is very high and will be even worse in near future especially in agricultural products.  At the same time, to cope with unwanted diseases in crops, the farmers are using high doses of pesticides to increase their productivity. However, the indiscriminate use of pesticide leads not only undesirable effects on the environment and public health but also the overall sustainability of agricultural practices.\n\nIn addition to overuse of pesticides, the water used for the irrigation especially in urban area is heavily polluted with human faecal matter. The use of highly polluted water (wastewater) in irrigation is known to transmit excreta-related diseases as it has high levels of pathogenic micro-organisms such as bacteria, viruses, parasitic worms and protozoa. Vegetables most commonly grown in urban farms in Nepal are lettuce, cabbage, green pepper and spring onions, potatoes, radish, carrot etc. This has raised serious public health concerns from local authorities, the media and consumers.\n\nThis research work will provide the impacts of climate change on food safety in Nepal in detail and the globe as a whole to assess the risks related to climate change. As such the impacts of climate change on microbial safety of leafy green vegetables will be assessed. Similarly, the pesticide residue and mycotoxin level of selected food crops will be analyzed and good agricultural practices will be formulated and suggested to the stakeholders.\n\nIt is suggested that the contamination of green leafy vegetables and associated pathogens and their survival is strongly related to climatic conditions especially due to rise of temperature and variation in precipitation pattern. The impacts of climate change on contamination sources and pathway of food borne pathogens on green leafy vegetables will be recognized. Similarly, The major factors for change of pesticide use and pesticide activity or degradation due to climate change will be identified. Furthermore, the effects of rain intensity on pesticide residues on selected crops will be studied to find out the effect of extreme weather on the pesticide availability on the crop. Likewise, the major factors that contribute to higher level of mycotoxin in food crops due to climate shift will be identified and to ensure the safety of food, different strategy will be suggested to farmer, consumer and trader.\n\n\nThis project aims to gather information by conducting research work selected area of study on the impact of climate change on food safety. It therefore includes conceptual frameworks, field observations and interview, literature review, laboratory research, training and awareness program. This will help to find out the actual scenario of the impacts of climate change on food safety at local and national level, evaluate options for the adaptation and mitigation measures. Furthermore, communication with stakeholder will provide opportunity to advice on best practices, management system and policy decisions. The findings of the research works can be discussed on international platform as well and the most importantly it creates door to have international collaboration on this global problem.', 'The study area will be will be selected on the basis of ecological belt of Nepal. The cereals like rice and wheat will be targeted in in the Terai and the valleys while in mid- hills focus will be on maize. High ways / road corridor and peri-urban area will be targeted for fresh vegetables. Microbiological contamination will be tested on only leafy green vegetables. \n\nThe study will be done by carrying following several activities: \n\n1. Stakeholder interviews and workshops \nThis starting–up activity will be done first. It will be done with local authorities, and associations representing farmers, sellers, and consumers to (i) introduce the project, (ii) learn about awareness levels on the health risk posed by consumption of mycotoxin contaminated  food, misuse / abuse of pesticides , Users'' knowledge on the quality of the pesticides , Users'' knowledge on the availability of other types of pesticides alternative to banned ones and perceptions on water pollution, vegetable contamination and options for health risk reduction, and (iii) analyses of expectations of stakeholders from the project. Opportunities and constraints for health risk reduction will be identified and ranked using semi-quantitative methods and SWOT analysis \n\n2. Literature study \nIt includes collection of data of previous research work on related field. The relation of level of mycotoxin contaminated food and pesticide residue in crops with climate change will be established on the basis of metrological data. \n\n3. Monitoring and evaluation of farming and selling practices \nIt will entail: \n3.1 Mapping of major farming sites using where possible GIS methods, topographical maps etc. \n3.2 Group discussions with farmers in each farming sites to understand the main farming and marketing practices during both dry and wet seasons\n\n4. Mycotoxin and Pesticide residue analysis of selected crops\nStudy will focus on determining toxigenic fungi isolated from various food grown in different ecological niches.\nLaboratory test will be performed to see determine level of mycotoxin and pesticide residue in sample collected from study area\n\n5. Development of mycotoxin and pesticide testing kits which can be cheaper and easier to use for smallholder farmer. \n\n6.Microbial Quality of irrigation water, crops\nSampling of irrigation water and selected crops will be selected from growing sites for the detection of coliform and helminth egg population.\n\n7. Guidelines development, training and awareness programs \n7.1 Guidelines and awareness materials will be developed for the different local stakeholder’s i.e. farmers,  womens group, households, authorities on options and low-cost technologies for health risk reduction. \n7.2 A training and awareness program with individual modules for farmer groups, consumer groups, market women, and authorities. \n\n7.3 Capacity building/ students training \nThe project intends to train students in its research activities. At least two M.Sc. students, about four B.Sc. students, research assistants, and several undergraduate students of both gender will be involved \n\n8. Planning workshops and reviews \nWorkshops involving the PIs, participating institutions, other investigators, support staff, City authorities, Policy makers, and others will be held for planning and reviewing of on-going activities. There will be annual review and planning meetings and end of Project reviews. \n\n8. Data analysis \nThe data will be analyzed using SPSS for Windows 10. Faecal coliform populations (MPN) will be normalized by log transformation before subjecting to analysis of variance (ANOVA). Non-parametric analyses will be also used where appropriate. Results of analysis will be quoted at p < 0.05 level of significance.', '• The concept of climate change and its impacts in safety of agricultural products is realized at local, national and international level. \n• Farmers’ knowledge system regarding causal factors of mycotoxin and pesticide (mis)use and health impacts is documented.\n• Assurance of food safety on food commodities and green leafy vegetables.\n• Enhanced consumer safety and export potentiality.\n•  Appropriate health risk reduction strategies identified and tested, and their impact on livelihoods and agricultural productivity assessed. \n•  Guidelines, awareness materials and training modules developed for stakeholders (farmers, sellers, consumers, authorities, WHO) on risk reducing options and technologies.\n•  Human capacity built through collaborative training of students (Ph.D., M.Sc., and undergraduate and laboratory assistants).\n• The occurrence of aflatoxin at plain Terai areas hills and mountain areas will be assessed. The onset of aflatoxin at lower land plus the contaminants of fuminosins at upper hills and mountainous area will be assessed thoroughly; and likewise the safety measures for curbing the contaminants level at an acceptance level will be developed and implemented to all the major stakeholders such as agriculture extensions, farmer and consumers groups as well.\n• Implementation of Good Agricultural practices\n\n\nTo tackle the climate change and its impact on food safety, a high level of human resource capacity is required to research, plan, implement and monitor if the desired program results are to be achieved.  This project aims to build human capacity in related area which can be helpful to achieve the target objective of government to tackle the climate change. Similarly, the participant in this project will be from all ecological regions of nation especially from project districts will benefit locally and after the completion of project the nation can be benefited from the findings that will entail the overall scenario of nation. This will also help to make appropriate guideline and policy to tackle the food safety issue that is directly related to climate change.', '1. Participating institutions will be informed about the project, given their matching funds and committed them by signing letters. \n2. Several groups i.e. farmers, local authorities, sellers, consumers etc. will be involved in this study and regular meetings will be held to get their feedback, advice and also suggest them based on their queries.\n3. Assessing and evaluation of selected farms using productivity performance indicators (economics, agronomic, water use). \n\n4The information will be disseminated as described below:\n\n-Stakeholders involved in the research process will be having first-hand information from the activities and workshops. Through the developed guidelines on improving productivity, innovative farmers (who were participants in the research process) from each study area will be trained further together with extension agents to relay and practically demonstrate the information to their fellow farmers. The developed guidelines will be written in farmer-friendly booklets and in local languages, which will be made available free to the farmers and a demonstration plot will be acquired in each selected farming site. The extension service and NGOs working with farmers will be involved\n\n- Training and awareness program with individual modules (with stakeholder specific demonstration workshops, joint farm/market visits, awareness material, poster, videos etc. in local languages) will target farmer groups, consumer groups, market women, and authorities.\n\n- Through the press, local NGOs and collaborating (consumer, women) associations for the general public.\n\nThe monitoring of mycotoxin, pesticide residue level in food commodities and microbial contamination of green leafy vegetables can contribute to the identification of an emerging problem which can help to get feedback on the effectiveness of suggested good agricultural practice. This can contribute to the conduct of risk assessments to provide science based acceptable limits for contamination.  Model which has been already used in other research work could be applicable in this research work based on meteorological and insects’ population data for the prediction of mycotoxin outbreaks. The project will lead to improved awareness on climate change and its consequence on food safety. This will actively contribute options for the reduction of fungal contamination and level of pesticides residue in food crops and diseases related to wastewater irrigation. \n\nSome of the direct impacts on stakeholders are as enlisted below:\n\n• The level of mycotoxin and pesticide residue in food crops produced in selected study area will be lowered and brought to the safe limit of use by implementing appropriate pre and post harvesting technology. \n• As most vegetables found in urban markets are produced in the city or its closest vicinity, almost all urban consumers of vegetables will benefit due to acceptable level of pesticide, safer wastewater and crop management on farm and reduce microbial contamination in markets.\n• The general public will benefit through raised public awareness on risks and risk-reducing options related to pesticide, water pollution and agriculture.\n• Policy makers will benefit from practical guidelines to be obtained for their decision support, which can be considered in policy revision and formulation of regulations and bye-laws.', '80,000', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/a_letter_from_endorsement_from_organization.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/BudgetTemplate1.xlsx', 144, NULL, 'complete', 'yes', 1410092467, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, 'yes'),

Dave’s research is on ICT applications and how this has impacted society more particularly the education sector while Cora’s work is focused on the intersection of economics and its implications to development.  Dave was once the dean of the Computer Science department of Silliman University while Cora is the chair of the University of San Carlos’s economics department. Dave’s doctoral dissertation is on the implementation of ICT in higher educational institutions in the Philippines, while Cora wrote on the valuation of intellectual capital.\n\nThe three researchers, though affiliated each in different universities, submit this proposal through Step Up Consulting, managed by the lead researcher.  This is a social enterprise offering three core services to clients – research, capacity building, and financial management. This is a strategic decision to make because open science, being an emerging field, is not part of the research agenda of their institutions and may conflict with institutional priorities. Both Silliman University and the University of San Carlos, the institutions where Dave and Cora come from,  have publishing houses.', 'SCIENCE THAT MATTERS:  MOTIVATION, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR OPEN AND RELEVANT SCIENCE IN THE PHILIPPINES', 'Philippines', 'Open science, defined as a state where “scientific knowledge of all kinds” are “shared as early as is practical in the discovery process” (Nielsen, 2011) is a concept that is rarely discussed in the Philippine context and is rarely written about.  The recent trend in the country which is closest to open and collaborative science idea is the move of universities and think tanks to make available researchers in the website and publish scholarly publications as open-access journals (ejournals.ph).\n\nLittle is known about the motivations why universities are moving towards this trajectory – for example, whether academic institutions have realized that knowledge is a public good or it just a reaction to the trends of the times.  In a context of publish-or-perish meritocracy system in the grant of tenure and promotion of academics, there is no legal requirement to open publications to the public and for free.  Also, university publishing houses are still operating in closed regimes, such that while journals are free and downloadable, books are not.  In the supply of “discovered knowledge”, it does seem that academic institutions in the country are two-faced.  To date, studies on whether individual researchers and academics are embracing this change have not been conducted also, such that both organizational and personal motivations for scholarly openness is not yet well understood.\n\nLittle is also known whether this process of opening up is intended for a particular purpose and whether that purpose has been met.  In communications theory, an act of communication has to have a particular audience in mind so that it becomes effective. So questions whether this act of opening up is intended for a particular purpose and audience is critical so that an evaluative assessment of the achievement of results and reach can be measured. This research will entirely focus on institutions of higher learning  in the Philippines and is intended to answer the following questions:\n\na. What motivates institutions of higher learning to make scholarly knowledge freely available to everyone? What is the goal? Who are the intended audience in this process?\nb. What motivates individual researchers and scholars to make their scholarly work freely available to everyone? What is the intention? Who are the intended audience?\nc. How are the results achieved/not achieved and the intended audience reached/not reached by both organizations and individuals which opened their scholarly knowledge to the public? What available evidence indicates this?  \nd. What are the challenges in making scholarly knowledge freely available to everyone?\ne. What opportunities exist to ensure that this current trend will continue in the future? What is the likelihood that other activities in open science (e.g. publication of open data sets, engaging citizens in the design and conduct of research, development of alternative scholarly evaluation systems) will take its shape in the Philippines?\n   \nAnswering these questions are critical for several reasons.  Firstly, this will help us understand the underlying motivation and the goals of both institutions of higher learning and whether this can sustainably contribute to wider societal outcomes.  An evidence of result and reach, this research will argue, is necessary in order to make the effort cost-effective and sustainable, especially that providing knowledge publicly also has its associated costs. Secondly, answering these questions will help us understand what policies, programs, activities, and services are necessary to ensure that an enabling environment for open and collaborative, as well as relevant knowledge creation and sharing can be created.  Thirdly, this will help us in understanding the processes involved in opening-up knowledge and whether this trajectory will likely continue to allow even other practices of openness – like citizen and public engagement in knowledge creation and more inclusive metrics and systems for evaluation.', 'There is an underlying assumption in this research – that most of the knowledge produced by academics finds its way to academic journals.  This assumption is couched on the fact that tenure and merit systems for the promotions of academics requires publication of work in academic journals.  Other publication options, in the traditional sense, are books and newspaper columns, the former normally registered with copyrights, and the latter not necessarily part of the review process of academics.\n\nThe focus will essentially be on academic institutions undertaking research.  The research will make use of both quantitative and qualitative methods in answering the research question. This will involve four processes:\n\na. Inventory of Academic Journals – An inventory of academic journals produced in the country will be undertaken and will be classified in four ways – open or closed, geographic location of publisher,  status of accreditation by the Commission of Higher Education (CHED), and thematic or sectoral focus. An inventory of contributors will also be conducted in each of the journals and from 2007 to 2012.  \nb. Survey of writers/contributors – an online survey through survey monkey, or an appropriate alternative will be conducted primarily to answer questions (b) and (c) above.  The survey will be sent to all contributors in the online journals A fifty percent survey turnout will be considered sufficient.  (This is an initial estimate, actual numbers will be generated when we are able to get the number of contributors in the period covered. Prior to conduct of online survey, this will be pilot-tested for purposes of determining feasibility and validity.\nc. Key informant interviews (KIIs) of selected journals – A purposive sample will be drawn from the list of academic journals in the inventory.  At this initial stage, it is thought that the sample will be clustered into geographical location (in order to deal with the archipelagic nature of the country, most likely Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, the three major island group).  Ten journals will be selected from the “open” group, and 10 journals will be selected from the “closed” group.  It is also planned that to ensure representation from the difference disciplines, a probability-proportional-to-size sampling will be done for the disciplines. To ensure also that major journals are included, the CHED classification will also be used in such a way that both big and small journals are represented in the sample. The twenty journals will be surveyed, primarily to answer questions   a, c, d, and e.  The responses to the intended audience will be used in order to appropriately select the key informant interviews of users in letter (d) below.\nFor this purpose, an interview guide will be constructed and this will be pilot-tested prior to actual conduct.\nd. Key informant interview of intended audience – Based on the responses regarding “supposed” audience from the KII of selected journals, representatives from the key organizations or groups representing intended audience (e.g. policy makers, farmers, businessmen). These representatives will be interviewed regarding use of knowledge, their involvement in knowledge production, and their views of research, to contribute, more particularly, in answering to questions c, and e above.  An interview guide will also be conducted for this purpose.  All KIIs will be conducted by the research team members themselves.  \n\nIt is initially planned that methods (b) and (c) will draw inspiration from the Research Information Network and National Endowment for Science, Technology, and the Arts study in 2010 entitled “Open to All: Case Studies in Openness in Research”.  A sampling of questions is provided in the Annexes to the report.  In the case of item (c), several research utilization studies will be used to answer questions related to this area.  \n\nThe survey will be analyzed quantitatively using appropriate tests, ranging from descriptive to regressions, when there is a need to do so.  The data analysis process will largely be dependent on the final questionnaire that will be formulated for the survey.  In the case of key informant interviews, qualitative themes will be discerned from the transcripts and these will be clustered into main ideas that respond to the key research questions.  For the inventory of journals, a pure descriptive analysis will be employed, in order to capture the current status of journal publishing in the country.', 'The research is relevant and important because this will be the first time that an inventory of journals from within the Philippines, will be conducted, both open-access and traditional. Secondly, the research is also important in understanding the motivations of those who were quick to publish journals in open formats and those who prefer to continue with publishing in traditional formats.  It will also look into how publishing houses of universities have one foot in open access and the other in traditional publishing format.  The major contribution then, of this research, is to understand the status of open and collaborative science in the country, particularly in the context of institutions of higher learning.\n\nThe research also has the potential to contribute to the following outcomes:\n\na. Research and publication policies of universities that would potentially encourage more open and relevant  science by involving intended users to influence the research agenda and determine the research questions of individual research projects, as well as more\nb. Policies at the level of the Commission in Higher Education especially in considering in its criteria of accrediting research journals more indicators or metrics related to openness.\nc. More relevant research projects that would deal with questions related to development (e.g. curbing dengue fever incidence, value chain analysis and feasibility studies of agricultural commodities, and other related topics) as they are articulated by different stakeholders\nd. More quality and rigour in the review of journal articles, and more collaboration among researchers in ensuring better and quality research (e.g. open reviews). In this way, online journals will be regarded as journals of quality and not be classified as predatory\n\nFor this purpose, research university consortia (e.g. PAASCU, PACU, among others), the Commission in Higher Education, and the universities that are part of this study will be involved in the finalization of the research questions, the presentation of preliminary findings, and in the presentation of final results.  This research will also employ open science methodology in order to ensure that it walks its talk regarding the process of knowledge creation.', 'Monitoring in this project will be focused on the effectiveness and efficiency in the conduct of activities and in the use of resources.  Monitoring will be embedded within the work of the project team.  An online project organizer will be set up to track progress of the research against schedule activities and milestones.  \nThe evaluation and learning of this research project will be anchored on process-based evaluation frameworks.  The primary user of the results of the evaluation exercise will be the research team itself.  The purpose of the evaluation is to assess the effectiveness of the research team and the processes used in communicating the purpose, process, and results of the research to research participants as well as external stakeholders.  In a way, it can touch on evaluating the effectiveness of open data research and communication so that the researchers will be informed as to how to conduct open data research and communication better.\nPrimarily, the evaluation will answer the following questions:\na. What processes were undertaken by the researchers in conducting the research and communicating the research findings?\nb. How effective or ineffective are these processes in achieving the objectives of the research and in communicating its results to intended audience?\nc. In what way can these processes be improved if a similar activity will be conducted in the future?\nAn external consultant will be hired to undertake this evaluation.', '75,075', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/endorsement_-_open_science_proposal1.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudgetStep_Up1.xlsx', 105, NULL, 'complete', 'yes', 1410103878, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, 'yes');

The emergence of hackerspaces, maker communities, and the BIYbio (Do-It-Yourself biology) movement, with their emphasis on building open source and citizen science laboratories and alternative research and development (R&D) spaces, supports development of human and knowledge capacity in local communities of the Global South for creative scientific research and education delivery. These efforts bring innovative solutions to development challenges in science education, South to South (and to North) knowledge networks and transfer, and citizen empowerment. Food security is a key development challenge facing the world today. This proposal aims to generate evidence for supporting grassroots forms of research and innovation with emphasis on supporting agricultural open microbiology research for soil biodiversity and bioremediation, which are key issues for many agrarian communities in the Global South. \nThe issues of food, health, and knowledge sovereignty are all closely related and equally contested, because the current knowledge generation paradigm focuses too narrowly on patents and corporate forms of R&D. With the proliferation of alternative R&D spaces, however, there is an opportunity to re-distribute the power of knowledge generation to a wider global public. In this respect, we propose a pilot study on Open Source Hardware (OSHW) and Open Data efforts in the Global South to assess their impact on the research infrastructure, communities of practice, and science education. In two phases, this study will (1) evaluate and map the existing documentation, utilization and dissemination of Open Science Hardware (OSHW) efforts in the alternative research communities in Indonesia and Nepal (partially the Philippines), (2) determine the hardware challenges and needs of the aforementioned communities, and (3) test and evaluate the cost, customizability, and effectiveness of a model of Open Source Hardware (OSHW) laboratory to be known as MOBIOL (Mobile Microbiology Laboratory) in South and Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Nepal, India and the Philippines).\nThese activities will explore the following research questions cutting across Themes 2, 3 and 4 with strong links to Theme 1: \n1. What are the opportunities and limits of this model of research and development? \n2. What are the growth and development dynamics of collaborative alternative research networks that use OSHW? \n3. How does OSHW enable science education and support open and citizen research projects in places without publicly accessible scientific and technological infrastructure?\nThe alternative R&D structures around hackerspaces, makerspaces, and open research communities have created their own networks of sharing knowledge independent from educational, research, governmental, and corporate institutions. These networks constitute a globally connected infrastructure that shares open source technology and design, which are participatory, inclusive, and low-cost, and distributed through platforms such as wikis, YouTube and Vimeo, and other services such as Instructables.com, where anyone can upload or follow DIY projects. Ultimately, as a largely informal movement, these projects are often financed by community members, crowdsourcing campaigns, and ad hoc grants, which raise the question of financial sustainability for many of these alternative research and learning movements and spaces.  In the first phase we plan to document and describe the use of the social media tools and the existing models of financing and managing these projects. The systemic evaluation of the current state of OSHW laboratory tools in Asia is highly relevant for identifying the key areas in need of future development and lessons that can guide development of additional equipment, which will augment and evolve MOBIOL. A key component of this process also includes a detailed cost analysis and a design focus on customizability of the scientific equipment based on availability of local resources.\nThe democratic and creative appropriations of instruction delivery, science protocols, and open source technologies in these alternative R&D networks enable unique cooperation opportunities between the aforementioned communities and established educational institutions, such as universities, and unconventional research partners, such as artists and designers. New networks that defy common stereotypes and divisions between the developing and developed world, community and institution, amateur and expert, and indigenous and scientific knowledge require new policies and infrastructure that will enable best utilization and dissemination of the collective efforts of this breadth of people. In bringing these actors together with OSHW, we plan to leverage this collective creative power to challenge the status quo for established grassroots and top-down movements in finding solutions for development challenges.', 'By taking the best (and the mostdelightfully unpredictable and exciting) ideals of Open and Collaborative Science, this project aims to deliver strong data and evidence supporting alternative, open, and community R&D spaces and movements. This will be a participatory action research project, where data and experiences will be uploaded in real-time during the planned workshops and seminars to publicly available sources throughout the research period, which will then be synthesized into academic papers available for variable open distribution channels and kits offered to other communities. The project will take place over two phases in order to best address our research questions in relation to OSHW and key development challenges supporting the ideals of OCSDNet. \nIn Phase 1, we will describe, map, and evaluate open hardware for science efforts in Indonesia, Nepal and Philippines since 2009. We will use GitHub in the form of an open living book, in which we will share data, insights, and experiences in real time. This review will take into account the short and long term impacts on stakeholders’ interactions (between communities, universities, and other actors), formats (workshops, festivals, peer-learning), and public, regional and global research networks (makerspaces, hackerspaces, university consortiums, new media centers, NGOs), use of the social media tools for documentation and dissemination of design and data, models of financing and managing these projects, the availability of local resources (electronic parts etc.), also other issues. We plan to conduct interviews and organize the available online data on these projects.  Our case study sites will help us define a framework to support Open Research Infrastructure in South and Southeast Asia with a set of recommendations and warnings based on a database of existing designs, best practices, examples of failures, and other available data and insight. This resource will serve as both material for policy recommendations and as a manual for scaling open research infrastructure regarding citizen science and community-orientated science in the Global South. Based on the data, insights, experiences, stories and recommendations from Phase 1, we will plan Phase 2. \nPhase 2 consists of the design and testing of the Open Mobile Microbiology Lab concept in four workshops for designers, scientists, citizen scientists, students, and interested community members in Yogyakarta, Kathmandu, Manila and Dharamshala. This will include the design and prototyping of open hardware tools for setting up a mobile microbiology lab. Initial plans for the prototype design kit include a microscope, incubator, sterilization chamber, anaerobic chamber, PCR machine, and gel box. Our design process will be open to critique and assistance to the greater OCS community. This prototype kit will then be tested in workshops, where we will invite academic and scientists in Indonesia, Nepal, India to work with our research team on building and designing tools needed for the Open Mobile Microbiology Lab. All information will be documented and disseminated through a public project wiki and via Github with full details on design and fabrication instructions and modifications for each locality, including the discussion details regarding localization of equipment designs. The wiki format will enable scientists and designers in a given place to share methodologies of work on various educational level and further improve the design. These workshops will also involve citizen science organizations, academia, students and youth, and other interested individuals. \nThese workshops, while hardware design and prototyping focused, are baseless without contextualizing the need for such equipment in a world largely defined by technical innovations emerging from inaccessible research institutions. Therefore, these workshops, and the entire project as whole with its focus on agricultural microbiology in the frame of food security, will aim to provide an open and accessible educational experience for all participants in a way that promotes strong principles of collaboration and transparency. \nCollaborating field site organizations (details about the team in the addendum):\nIndonesia (Yogyakarta): \nHouse of Natural Fiberhttp://www.natural-fiber.com/ and HONFablabhttp://www.honfablab.org/, (Yogyakarta New Media Art Laboratory with citizen science and makers projects since 1999)\nLifePatch http://lifepatch.org (citizen initiative in art, science, and technology(citizen science projects since 2011).\nGraduate School of Biotechnology, Faculty of Agriculture, GadjahMada University (UGM)http://www.faperta.ugm.ac.id/newbie/en/department/microbiology/index.php\nNepal (Kathmandu):\nKarkhana Collective http://www.karkhana.asia/(hackerspace and experiential science education start-up with makerspace aspirations since 2012)\nIndia (Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh):\nHillhacks Initiative http://hillhacks.in  (an annual two week long event with participants from all around India and all around the world organized by CCC and freaklabs as well as participants from MIT Media Lab, Tibetan Children''s Village, Dharamsala International Film Festival, Ghoomakadhackerspace, and many more).\nPhilippines (Manila): \nAwesome Labs - https://www.facebook.com/pages/Awesome-Lab-Inc/ (hackerspace and makerspace in the Philippines specializing on open hardware with social impact, educational project).', 'The expected outcomes of this project include a spectrum of outputs that are both theoretically and practically relevant. This includes systematically gathered information about the state of OCS and OSHW since 2009, community building and South-South knowledge exchange, and a set of prototyped laboratory equipment for use by grassroots organizations around the world with detailed design schematics and knowledge about successes and failures in the design, testing, and usage processes. Usefulness for overall context of OCSDNetinclude the development ofa strong community in South and Southeast Asia to integrate into OCSDNet, and a strong set of field tested hardware schematics for real world use and experimentation that can be scaled into other branches of life science.\nThese outcomes provide tools and knowledge that span the digital and physical world seamlessly. They will be produced in ways that will be open, flexible, and accessible in anticipation that various aspects of the outcomes will be reproduced and delivered in a variety of mediums including physical media, variable digital screen sizes, and spoken word. \nThis is important because these outcomes contribute to the foundation of OCS as it comes into its own as a mode of research at the grassroots level. Food security is an increasingly local battle, and the ability of communities to address these concerns in ways that are locally contextualized requires access to knowledge in forms that are understandable to people of all walks in life. These outcomes create a foundation for local communities and alternative research networks in the area of research and data collection methods, as the world becomes more connected through advances in communication technology and the internet. \nPerhaps more importantly, this subsequent possibility of local communities and alternative research networks to build upon the original foundation of methods and databases, provides an opportunity for these communities to maintain their sovereignty in food, health, and knowledge while accessing collaborative networks of knowledge that recognize the unique qualities and values of local networks and contexts. To clarify, the openness of these networks and research methods in OCS contributes to not only the scientific body of research, but allows local communities to be attributed credit to their own advances in discovering and generating knowledge about their own environments, ecosystems, and communities rather than an outside group or individual. This is in hope that the rights to valuable resources and knowledge generation remain in the hands of the communities from which these pieces of information and practices came.', 'We will share data in real time throughout the project duration and curate them every four month into reports, which will be presented to the evaluators (PIs and collaborators on the projects), but also to the general public for feedback. The emphasis on real time data and multimedia is based on the observation that many citizen science groups in Indonesia and Nepal already use Facebook, Twitter and similar platforms to disseminate results of their work, but also to describe the process. We would like to harness these data with professional tools. This will be conducted not only by members of the research team, but will be crowd sourced through open peer review and collaboration through our Github and Wiki portals. Furthermore, we plan to integrate the Open Data Kit (http://opendatakit.org/) into our monitoring and evaluation efforts as a unique way to crowdsource monitoring and evaluation data throughout the entire process, with specific emphasis on our workshops, from our collaborators and workshop participants. Part of the workshop will be always an introduction into Mediawiki and OpenData kit and other tools for scientists to share the data collected over their open hardware equipment. Utilizing this platform will allow our team to aggregate data that may not have otherwise been considered quantitative, such as weather data, participant and collaborator location data, emotional data and feedback. Furthemore, Open Data Kit allows the possibility for gathering audiovisual data such as photographs, video, and sound that may otherwise have been overlooked or missed by the principal research team.

These networks constitute a globally connected infrastructure that shares open source technology and design, which are participatory, inclusive, and low-cost, and distributed through platforms such as wikis, YouTube and Vimeo, and other services such as Instructables.com, where anyone can upload or follow DIY projects.</p><p>Ultimately, as a largely informal movement, these projects are often financed by community members, crowdsourcing campaigns, and ad hoc grants, which raise the question of financial sustainability for many of these alternative research and learning movements and spaces. In the first phase we plan to document and describe the use of the social media tools and the existing models of financing and managing these projects.</p><p>The systemic evaluation of the current state of OSHW laboratory tools in Asia is highly relevant for identifying the key areas in need of future development and lessons that can guide development of additional equipment, which will augment and evolve MOBIOL. A key component of this process also includes a detailed cost analysis and a design focus on customizability of the scientific equipment based on availability of local resources. The democratic and creative appropriations of instruction delivery, science protocols, and open source technologies in these alternative R&amp;D networks enable unique cooperation opportunities between the aforementioned communities and established educational institutions, such as universities, and unconventional research partners, such as artists and designers.</p><p>New networks that defy common stereotypes and divisions between the developing and developed world, community and institution, amateur and expert, and indigenous and scientific knowledge require new policies and infrastructure that will enable best utilization and dissemination of the collective efforts of this breadth of people. In bringing these actors together with OSHW, we plan to leverage this collective creative power to challenge the status quo for established grassroots and top-down movements in finding solutions for development challenges.</p>', '<p>By taking the best (and the mostdelightfully unpredictable and exciting) ideals of Open and Collaborative Science, this project aims to deliver strong data and evidence supporting alternative, open, and community R&amp;D spaces and movements. This will be a participatory action research project, where data and experiences will be uploaded in real-time during the planned workshops and seminars to publicly available sources throughout the research period, which will then be synthesized into academic papers available for variable open distribution channels and kits offered to other communities.</p><p>The project will take place over two phases in order to best address our research questions in relation to OSHW and key development challenges supporting the ideals of OCSDNet. In Phase 1, we will describe, map, and evaluate open hardware for science efforts in Indonesia, Nepal and Philippines since 2009. We will use GitHub in the form of an open living book, in which we will share data, insights, and experiences in real time.</p><p>This review will take into account the short and long term impacts on stakeholders&rsquo; interactions (between communities, universities, and other actors), formats (workshops, festivals, peer-learning), and public, regional and global research networks (makerspaces, hackerspaces, university consortiums, new media centers, NGOs), use of the social media tools for documentation and dissemination of design and data, models of financing and managing these projects, the availability of local resources (electronic parts etc.), also other issues. We plan to conduct interviews and organize the available online data on these projects.</p><p>Our case study sites will help us define a framework to support Open Research Infrastructure in South and Southeast Asia with a set of recommendations and warnings based on a database of existing designs, best practices, examples of failures, and other available data and insight. This resource will serve as both material for policy recommendations and as a manual for scaling open research infrastructure regarding citizen science and community-orientated science in the Global South. Based on the data, insights, experiences, stories and recommendations from Phase 1, we will plan Phase 2. Phase 2 consists of the design and testing of the Open Mobile Microbiology Lab concept in four workshops for designers, scientists, citizen scientists, students, and interested community members in Yogyakarta, Kathmandu, Manila and Dharamshala. This will include the design and prototyping of open hardware tools for setting up a mobile microbiology lab. Initial plans for the prototype design kit include a microscope, incubator, sterilization chamber, anaerobic chamber, PCR machine, and gel box. Our design process will be open to critique and assistance to the greater OCS community.</p><p>This prototype kit will then be tested in workshops, where we will invite academic and scientists in Indonesia, Nepal, India to work with our research team on building and designing tools needed for the Open Mobile Microbiology Lab. All information will be documented and disseminated through a public project wiki and via Github with full details on design and fabrication instructions and modifications for each locality, including the discussion details regarding localization of equipment designs.</p><p>The wiki format will enable scientists and designers in a given place to share methodologies of work on various educational level and further improve the design. These workshops will also involve citizen science organizations, academia, students and youth, and other interested individuals. These workshops, while hardware design and prototyping focused, are baseless without contextualizing the need for such equipment in a world largely defined by technical innovations emerging from inaccessible research institutions.</p><p>Therefore, these workshops, and the entire project as whole with its focus on agricultural microbiology in the frame of food security, will aim to provide an open and accessible educational experience for all participants in a way that promotes strong principles of collaboration and transparency.</p><p>Collaborating field site organizations (details about the team in the addendum): Indonesia (Yogyakarta): House of Natural Fiberhttp://www.natural-fiber.com/ and HONFablabhttp://www.honfablab.org/, (Yogyakarta New Media Art Laboratory with citizen science and makers projects since 1999) LifePatch http://lifepatch.org (citizen initiative in art, science, and technology(citizen science projects since 2011).</p><p>Graduate School of Biotechnology, Faculty of Agriculture, GadjahMada University (UGM)http://www.faperta.ugm.ac.id/newbie/en/department/microbiology/index.php Nepal (Kathmandu): Karkhana Collective http://www.karkhana.asia/(hackerspace and experiential science education start-up with makerspace aspirations since 2012) India (Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh): Hillhacks Initiative http://hillhacks.in (an annual two week long event with participants from all around India and all around the world organized by CCC and freaklabs as well as participants from MIT Media Lab, Tibetan Children&#39;s Village, Dharamsala International Film Festival, Ghoomakadhackerspace, and many more).</p><p>Philippines (Manila): Awesome Labs - https://www.facebook.com/pages/Awesome-Lab-Inc/ (hackerspace and makerspace in the Philippines specializing on open hardware with social impact, educational project).</p>', '<p>The expected outcomes of this project include a spectrum of outputs that are both theoretically and practically relevant. This includes systematically gathered information about the state of OCS and OSHW since 2009, community building and South-South knowledge exchange, and a set of prototyped laboratory equipment for use by grassroots organizations around the world with detailed design schematics and knowledge about successes and failures in the design, testing, and usage processes.</p><p>Usefulness for overall context of OCSDNetinclude the development ofa strong community in South and Southeast Asia to integrate into OCSDNet, and a strong set of field tested hardware schematics for real world use and experimentation that can be scaled into other branches of life science. These outcomes provide tools and knowledge that span the digital and physical world seamlessly. They will be produced in ways that will be open, flexible, and accessible in anticipation that various aspects of the outcomes will be reproduced and delivered in a variety of mediums including physical media, variable digital screen sizes, and spoken word.</p><p>This is important because these outcomes contribute to the foundation of OCS as it comes into its own as a mode of research at the grassroots level. Food security is an increasingly local battle, and the ability of communities to address these concerns in ways that are locally contextualized requires access to knowledge in forms that are understandable to people of all walks in life. These outcomes create a foundation for local communities and alternative research networks in the area of research and data collection methods, as the world becomes more connected through advances in communication technology and the internet.</p><p>Perhaps more importantly, this subsequent possibility of local communities and alternative research networks to build upon the original foundation of methods and databases, provides an opportunity for these communities to maintain their sovereignty in food, health, and knowledge while accessing collaborative networks of knowledge that recognize the unique qualities and values of local networks and contexts.</p><p>To clarify, the openness of these networks and research methods in OCS contributes to not only the scientific body of research, but allows local communities to be attributed credit to their own advances in discovering and generating knowledge about their own environments, ecosystems, and communities rather than an outside group or individual. This is in hope that the rights to valuable resources and knowledge generation remain in the hands of the communities from which these pieces of information and practices came.</p>', '<p>We will share data in real time throughout the project duration and curate them every four month into reports, which will be presented to the evaluators (PIs and collaborators on the projects), but also to the general public for feedback.</p><p>The emphasis on real time data and multimedia is based on the observation that many citizen science groups in Indonesia and Nepal already use Facebook, Twitter and similar platforms to disseminate results of their work, but also to describe the process.</p><p>We would like to harness these data with professional tools. This will be conducted not only by members of the research team, but will be crowd sourced through open peer review and collaboration through our Github and Wiki portals.</p><p>Furthermore, we plan to integrate the Open Data Kit (http://opendatakit.org/) into our monitoring and evaluation efforts as a unique way to crowdsource monitoring and evaluation data throughout the entire process, with specific emphasis on our workshops, from our collaborators and workshop participants. Part of the workshop will be always an introduction into Mediawiki and OpenData kit and other tools for scientists to share the data collected over their open hardware equipment.</p><p>Utilizing this platform will allow our team to aggregate data that may not have otherwise been considered quantitative, such as weather data, participant and collaborator location data, emotional data and feedback.</p><p>Furthemore, Open Data Kit allows the possibility for gathering audiovisual data such as photographs, video, and sound that may otherwise have been overlooked or missed by the principal research team. We plan to collaborate with the Open Knowledge Foundation and Gigascience Journal on our data gathering activities and integrate theirs curricula and recommendations in the workshops.</p>', '79200', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/letter_of_endorsement1.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudget2014Final3.xlsx', 154, 252, 'complete', 'yes', 1411227665, 'complete', 'A hardware and capabilities based project that will address capacity challenges directly in South East Asia.

(25, 'As a research student in management, I had learned building and constructing theoretical framework by consulting previous literature especially in the field of knowledge management broadly and in knowledge sharing, social networks, communities of practice narrowly. My interests are to study the collaborative structures of the public sector that have important role for building knowledge based economy. For this I had studied the knowledge movement in the knowledge based economy and my major contribution in this study also explains the micro level relationships towards knowledge based economy.\nI also had experience in designing research by using both qualitative and quantitative approaches, data cleaning and analysis by using SPSS, AMOS and SAS softwares, Conducting, handling and analyzing interviews by complementing site observation and documents thematic analysis and most importantly formulating policies and strategies, by using case study approach, for a public sector  organization. \nI had previously been involved in research projects that adopted the triangulation approaches in the field of knowledge management broadly and in knowledge sharing through communities of practice, role of ICT, capabilities of human resource, barriers in knowledge management initiatives etc narrowly. By qualitative and quantitative analysis of the actual and required capabilities of the case study organization, the knowledge management strategy was formulated that would guide the organization for successful implementation of knowledge management initiative especially through informal networking and collaboration among public sector employees.', 'Open and collaborative culture in public sector: Differences and commonalities in developing and developed countries', 'Pakistan, China, Canada,', 'The actual economic wealth is now the consciousness (wisdom and inner knowledge) not the tangible resources (Hoeller, 2002), and in Drucker’s words, it is the knowledge not the physical resources that matter (1993, p.38). Machlup (1962) was among the first authors who initially worked on information and knowledge as the new category of economic wealth and established a link between information, knowledge and economy (Mann & Wüstemann, 2010). Information and knowledge, as a new category of economic wealth, has led us from the industrial to the informational logic era (Putnam, Costa, & GARRIDO, 2000), and has prompted transformation from an industrial society to an information society (Castells, 2000). This transition is due to the growing and central role of information and knowledge in rational decision making (Mann & Wüstemann, 2010).  \nThe role of information and knowledge in decision making can be studied from both macro and micro level perspectives. However, as is evident from the review of literature, the micro level perspective covering individuals and their interaction has been surprisingly neglected (Foss, 2009; Foss, Husted, & Michailova, 2010). Little effort has been made to evolve a research strategy that explores ways to reduce information asymmetry (Silva & Félix, 2012), the most critical problem faced by knowledge economy today (Mann & Wüstemann, 2010). \nMicro level focus starts with an organizations’ mechanism for managing information and knowledge called Knowledge Governance Mechanism (KGM) that facilitates and promotes information flow (Dawes, Cresswell, & Pardo, 2009) and knowledge networks (Gooderham, Minbaeva, & Pedersen, 2011) for enhancing information and knowledge sharing and use amongst organizational members, and thus helps in reducing information asymmetries (Silva & Félix, 2012). However, the bureaucratic nature of public sector organizations (Wilson, 2000) encourages inadequate information and knowledge sharing practices (Amayah, 2013) due to power game and social dilemmas that universally exist in bureaucracies (da Costa, 2011). Access to correct and timely information is important (Clarkson, Jacobsen, & Batcheller, 2007), which coupled with leaders’ phronesis knowledge (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 2011) plays a crucial role in decision making (McKenna, Rooney, & Boal, 2009).\nTherefore, a study of knowledge sharing practices to reduce information asymmetry for quality decision making in the public sector is extremely crucial and important. However, leader’s phronesis could not be ignored for decision quality. To achieve the purpose of the study, several hypothesis has been established keeping in view the following research questions.\nResearch Questions\n\n1. How could knowledge infrastructure be designed to maximize inclusive participation for OCS for reduction of information asymmetry?\n2.

Bureaucracy: What government agencies do and why they do it', 'There are two approaches to research: qualitative and quantitative. The former is used to describe the phenomenon with the use of words, while the later deals with numbers and statistics. Quantitative methods through statistics answer only what happens in a specific case or context, whereas to understand the phenomenon, a certain degree of qualitative method is required that answers how or the cause and effects of a phenomenon. Among the two approaches, selection depends on research problem and the nature of required information, but the combined approach can also be used when required. The advantages of conducting mixed methods research enable the phenomena to be studied through the use of multiple data collection techniques thus enabling the generation of multiple data sets. While the findings of single method research may be challenged, findings that have been developed through a variety of methods may be more difficult to contest. Thus, the use of a mixed methods approach can provide a more complete picture of a research problem, can help to address issues of validity and rigor, and provide triangulation of data - often identified as weaknesses of the use of a single methodology. The thesis also uses a combined approach to deal with the diverse population under study and the nature of data required. The quantitative approach will be used for assessment of the knowledge Governance Mechanism, information flow, social networks, social dilemma and information asymmetry. The qualitative approach will be used for identification of the elements of phronesis knowledge along with all variables that are used in quantitative study.\n\nPopulation and Sample: The population of the study constitute government employees from all three sectors of the Government i.e Government institutions, public sector organizations and state enterprises. Two organizations each from three sectors of government will be included in the study from all three countries.\nData Collection\nPilot Study: Several scholars recommend conducting a pilot case prior to embarking on the full research study (Stake, 1995, Yin, 1994). A pilot study allows the testing of research instruments and identifies areas for potential refinement (Benbasat et al., 1987, Yin, 1994). Pilot interviews and pilot survey will be conducted prior to the final data collection.\nInterviews: Qualitative data can be obtained through six forms. According to Yin (1994), these forms are documentation, archival records, interviews, direct observations, participant observation and physical artifacts. Yin (1994) has demonstrated that several different sources strengthen the case study data by approaching multiple measures of the same phenomenon. This use of multiple sources is called triangulation. This research will be used a triangulation concept to supplement interviews by analysis of the case participant, case environment pre, post and during interviews and the analysis of written documents in natural sites.\nInterviews will be conducted with heads of the public sector organizations who are involved in decision making. Semi-structured interview format will be used that includes number of questions prepared in advance. These questions will be served as a guide throughout the interview process while allowing flexibility. \nSurvey\nSurvey will be conducted to employees’ grade 17 and above by using a questionnaire. Questionnaire will be developed by using the literature.\nData Analysis: The data will be obtained from two approaches of interviews and survey. The obtained responses from the two approaches will be analyzed separately to develop an understanding. For quantitative data multiple regression analysis will be performed to validate the hypothesized relationships. The qualitative data will be analyzed by using thematic analysis and knowledge maps. Knowledge maps can be built to understand the leaders’ preferences and importance of knowledge and information and use of their phronesis.\nThe triangulation concept will facilitate to clearly and completely identify the information and knowledge sharing and information asymmetry situation in public sector organization as well as the leaders role to critically evaluate the available information and its application for decision making through their phronesis wisdom that is inline with the communities of practice in open and collaborative science theme.', 'This study intends to provide better understanding of the link between organizational knowledge governance mechanism and quality decisions in the public sector. Keeping in mind the knowledge movement (Foss, 2009) for knowledge based economy (Mann & Wüstemann, 2010), intra-organizational knowledge mechanism (Grandori, 1997) is the first and foremost element that needs to evaluate for the reduction of information asymmetry (Silva & Félix, 2012) through information flow and knowledge sharing. It also extends our understanding of the role of bureaucracy in information asymmetry and decision making. Information symmetry alone cannot provide opportunity to the leader to take such decisions that are beneficial for the organization in todays’ world where ethical and moral values that benefit the society are essential. Phronesis knowledge (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 2011) could provide a leader with such wisdom that can complement the complete and full information and better understanding of acquired information for quality decision making. Therefore, this study will provide with the complete picture of quality decisions that will guide the public sector for better contribution in building knowledge based economy. It further elaborate the difference between developed and developing countries knowledge Governance mechanism and decision quality along with bureaucratic structures role and leader''s cognitive choices for decision quality.\n This analysis should help us devise proper policies regarding Knowledge Governance Mechanism in the public sector that may facilitate intra-organizational information symmetry through properly managed information flow and open and collaborative networks through communities of practice. Through a better understanding of these issues, resourcing and funding can be appropriately allocated for integrated ICT system and to assist individuals engaged in collaborative initiatives. The study also extend the understanding of how bureaucratic structure is a hindrance in achievement of intra-organizational information symmetry. This understanding will provide guidance for the public sector policy makers to devise such a culture that will facilitate to avoid the "knowledge is power" syndrome. Furthermore, this study, through qualitative study, will also identify the elements of Phronesis knowledge of a leader that could be beneficial for taking such decisions that are ethically and morally important for the society.\nThis results of the study will be particularly guide intra-organizational collaboration and generally guide the quality decisions. The study will also benefit private organizations engaged in collaborative endeavors with public sector organizations.\nReferences:\nFoss, N. J. (2009).

Its main activities aim to support and assist villagers in their access to education, tutoring, literacy and education. Preferred among the possible actions are those involving communities and local stakeholders in the creation, development and implementation of projects. The organization seeks solutions that educate local people in sustainable development and promote collaborative networks and partnerships. To achieve these objectives, it is essential that people working or living in a rural area of Senegal are involved in the management and life of the association.', 'Socio-economicand socio-cultural impacts of the introduction of appropriate technologies in villages of the Sahel', 'Senegal: villages of Médina Niahème, Malem Hodar and Popenguine', 'The main objective of this study is to assess the impacts and benefits of the project "Les moulins du soleil" in each community wher it was implanted. Is is also to study the economic, cultural and environmental and social contexte in order to ensure the sustainability of the transmitted expertise. This fits directly into a perspective of empowerment and sustainable development. More concretely, the project will first draw a portrait of communities, stakeholders and political forces on the field,  and of their needs and the solutions they propose. Thereafter, we will evaluate all actual or expected impacts of the installation of appropriate technology on the population so they can be responsible for their development. \n\nFor 2 years, supervised by Professor Pierre Masson, students in Industrial Maintenance Techniques  and Mechanical Engineering Technology at the Cégep de Sherbrooke have developed two prototypes of millet mills powered by solar energy in two Senegalese communities, in collaboration with a Senegalo-Belgian NPO for one of mills (Malem-Hodar) and a Franco-Senegalese NGO for another mill (Samaane Village Association). These two organizations are working with groups of women groups in small communities in Senegal. These women have, on many occasions, express the need to have access to a millet mill to alleviate women''s work and attempt to break the chain of chronic lagging of school enrollment of women. Having been released of a significant portion of household chores, they will be able to stay in school. \n\nLast year, students of the program of Social and human sciences (sociology and anthropology) supervised by Professor Janie Poudrier, joined the project to better understand the working of these communities and to assess the contribution of the mill and to foster empowerment. We believe this empowerment will make the actions, determined in consultation with all stakeholders, more effective and also more  likely to improve the living conditions of the villagers, particuliarly those of women and children. \n\nInpired by this field experience, we plan this year to offer a technically enhanced version, by adding sensors to transmit real-time use of the mill. This device would provide guidelines for using local millers and diagnose possible causes of breakage. This communication tool will also serve to validate the relevance of implementing such mills. With these data, ee believe that other Senegalese or other communities in the wider Sahel may have access to micro-credit to finance the purchase by groups of women. \n\nThis type of intervention on the ground, combining the technological, environmental, socio-economic and socio-cultural aspects, creates lasting relationships with local stakeholders. These stakeholders are and continue to be trained and asked to ensure the monitoring of all project facets. We also  want our partners to promote a long-term commitment with the Senegalese communities. To do this, we want to return to the villages every year to see firsthand and collect from villagers specific informations about to the evolution of the situation, their needs and their resources. \n\nThis project targets three components of sustainable development, both for our canadian students and for Senegalese population. The social aspect is the education of our students to the the living conditions of women and children in Senegal; for Senegaleses, the results is a release of housework leading to a better access to literacy, education and health, especially for women and young women. On the environemental side,  we use of renewable energy (solar panels) and foster an awareness of plentiness of energy consumed in Canada. In Senegal, this translates into greater autonomy of villages, since they can use solar energy, abundant and free there; it is also the logical choice since no mill should run on diesel in Senegal. Finally, the economics of the projects is essentially to try to put in place mills at an affordable cost so it can be accessible, but also to make them as reliable as possible, (a contribution to the fight against planned obsolescence). Thus, the money that families are paying to use the mill can be reinvested in the village economy rather than serve the oil companies to pay the cost of diesel and lubricating oil.', 'Given the teaching mission at Cégep de Sherbrooke  and the requirements related to the acquisition and assessment of skills of our students, the educational model PEEEC (Education Program for the Environment to entrepreneurship and Citizenship) will form the basis for the proposed project. This program is recognized in Quebec and abroad, including by the International Organization of the Francophonie (OIF) and was exported to Senegal, South Korea, the United States, China, India, Hungary and Israel (http://www3.sympatico.ca/claude.poudrier). This tool is basically to get people to identify a need or address a meaningful problem in their community (living conditions of villagers in Senegal), to analyze it in the light of different issues (social, economic, environmental and ethical) and to implement an action plan and evaluate the result and their approach. The teacher can assess the skills of his choice through the process of research-action. \n\nSupervised by teachers Julie Dion, Pierre Masson, Janie Poudrier and consultant Anne-Sophie Demers, students from various disciplines (Sociology, Anthropology, Social Service Work, and Special Education, Industrial Maintenance and Electrical Engineering) will be brought to conduct research-action on Senegalese soil. Thus, researchers, students and stakeholders will be engaged in a collaborative relationship and dialogue. This type of research is focused on a problematic situation that fits into concrete social relations and is linked to an action for social change. This study will act on three levels at once: it is a strategy for research, intervention and training. \n\nThe purpose of this research, for students in humanities and social sciences will be to examine the economic, social and cultural benefits of millet mills (or other appropriate technologies that will result from our observations) on each community and to study development issues from the perspective of sustainability and empowerment by Senegalese villagers. Specifically, a portrait of the communities, their needs, the solutions they propose, of the actual or expected impacts of the installation of the mills will be produced by our students. To do this, observation checklists, as well as interview canvas will be developed prior to the mission and validated with relevant groups. The data analysis will provide an overall picture of the impact mills, or appropriate technology, and will enable the team to make a number of recommendations to both parties involved in cooperation Senegal. For students in industrial maintenance techniques and mechanical engineering, the purpose of the research will be to ensure the development and transfer of technical and technological knowledge of millet mill or appropriate technologies. \n\nThereafter, the data analysis will provide an overall picture of the impact of mills or appropriate technology that will enable us to make a number of recommendations to both parties involved in cooperation and Senegal and also to the next participants of the study. This step will provide an accurate representation and an analytical description of the results. The report of this research should indicate the specific contribution and the mutual influence of research students and villagers. The preparation and distribution of this report will be used to initiate a critical reflection on the social conditions that led to research-action. It will take the form of outreach to the college population during the year and subsequently, to the villagers and stakeholders during the mission the following year. Of course, some problems may arise both in terms of content and container. Indeed, the problems can be increased due to the fact that the process of communication (including cultural aspects and those related to language) and dissemination of the research process includes in itself several constraints; statements may be tinged with inherent contradictions and omissions. Moreover, the rules of prensentation of the report, intended to make it accessible, mays come into duality with the desire to account as fully as possible of the uncertainties, ambiguities and contradictions experienced during its development. The challeng will be to avoid not fall into subjectivity and make sure to give the opportunity for everyone involved to express themselves. Writings can sometimes translate value systems and ways of thinking of the writer. We must therefore focus on the collaborative writing through a tone not too complex (academic) nor too simple.', 'The main expected outcome of this study is the production of a portrait of communities and their stakeholders, of their needs and of the solutions they envisage. Secondly, il will provide an assessment of the overall impact, actual or expected, of the installation of appropriate technology on the population so they can take charge of their social and economic development. \n\nStudents in Industrial Maintenance, in Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering design and manufacture equipment that meets the needs of communities in developing countries. By using renewable energy and appropriate technology, they can meet the needs of members of the society''s most vulnerable: women and children in poor countries. Targeted sectors include the processing of agricultural products (millet mill). Mills Mil allow to liberate women and girls at work and allows greater autonomy and better schooling for girls \n\nIn addition to the technical aspect, the social aspect is also addressed by bringing together teachers and students from various disciplines who are planning the intervention to maximize the actions to improve the living conditions of women and children . The ''Moulins du Soleil'' already provide a technology showcase promoting , in the future, the proliferation of such facilities in Senegal. We believe that this research project will bring a new dimension to this project and possibly a boost. \n\nThe intervention on the ground enables us to create links with local stakeholders. These stakeholders are and continue to be trained and sollicitated to ensure the monitoring of all aspects of the project, both technical and human. In addition, we and our partners are promoting a long-term commitment with the Senegalese communities, so that we will return to the villages year after year to see firsthand the evolution of the situation and needs. \n\nSimilarly, this project, involving a contact with the realities of developing countries, is not without offering Quebec students a unique human experience that will mark their path as a citizen of the world. This experience of solidarity and cooperation will make better citizens and ambassadors engaged in a sustainable path.', 'Our main indicator will be the collective ownership of the solar Moulin or the implementation of appropriate technology by villagers. Fair and equitable distribution of income, the reduction in working hours for women and increasing the literacy of young girls are also among the benefits indicating success. Finally, the operation of the mill and the transfer of technical knowledge by the villagers themselves in another nearby community would also be a sign of success.\nSince this is an action research project, the results need to be evaluated on two years. Our main indicator will be the collective ownership of the solar Moulin or the implementation of appropriate technology by villagers.

(27, 'Tom Olijhoek, The Netherlands, 1951 is a molecular microbiologist by training. After studying microbiology, geology and astrobiology he did his PhD in molecular micro-biology (University of Amsterdam, 1983). He has worked in Kenya at the CGIAR-ILRI institute where he did medical research in tropical disease management. Since 2009 he runs Codex Consult, a consultancy firm on making science work for development. He has established numerous contacts with open science advocates worldwide. His current activities concern the development of open access impact assessment methods with CGIAR and UNESCO, and the development of an open access journal certification program funded by a consortium of SPARC, PLoS and others. Recently, he gained interest in building scientific networks in the area of agriculture and in the topic soil microbiology through his collaboration with Rubén Borge Robles (Researcher 2 above).\nIr. Rubén Borge Robles has over a decade experience in the development of fertilizers and soil improvers, which can be produced and used by farmers in the Global South. He has a rich and diverse experience in working with local communities in Europe (Spain, Italy), Africa (Ethiopia and Tanzania) and Southern America (Mexico). Ruben trains the farmers in their skills to produce fertilizers and soil improvers from local waste streams. Through the training in quality monitoring and individual learning cycles Ruben creates Communities of Practices who are able to maintain learn cycles and reach out to smallholder farmers in neighboring villages. Last year Ruben Borje Robles trained, with MetaMeta, 100+ farmers in four villages in Ethiopia (Rema, Arsi Negelle, Solulta and Holeta) through which 3 Communities of Practice were created. Based upon this positive experience MetaMeta would like to extend these activities, as well as seek pathways how to unlock (monitor, channel and share) data and knowledge which is continuously produced within these (and future) Communities of Practice. As the protocols and mechanism advocated in the OCSD Network match MetaMeta’s philosophy of open access to data and knowledge, we gladly welcome the consortium and project as articulated in this proposal. Earlier connections with Tom Olijhoek and MetaMeta’s online open media platform www.thewaterchannel.tv approved the value of a shared philosophy by bundling forces to improve and increase the scope of open access media to the wider public. \nMetaMeta Holding is an international research and development organization in the agricultural water sector. It has continuous staff presence in Nepal, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Yemen and The Netherlands; and a frequent assignments in Kenya, Southern Sudan, India, Ghana, Tanzania, Bangladesh, China and Vietnam. MetaMeta Ethiopia has been effective since 2006 (business license) and has upgraded its status till official Ethiopian R&D Company in 2013. Taye Alemayehu (Researcher 3 above) manages MetaMeta Ethiopia and supervises its programs and projects, including:\n- Ethiopia’s University Water Sector Partnership Program. See: http://www.universitywatersectorpartnership.org/ \n- The UPGro Programs ‘Roads for Water’ and ‘Safe Fluoride Sourcing’ focusing on unlocking science through open access platforms and publications.

See http://www.ethiopiacic.org/', ':  Towards a sustainable framework for open science in the Global South: connecting open science and development', 'Ethiopia', 'Creation and access to (scientific) data have become key in the functioning of societies and growth of markets in ‘The North’. The evolution and current features of the so-called knowledge society contain core lessons and building blocks for countries in the Global South, where linkages between (scientific) data, society and market development are less straightforward, visible and important. Having said this, the creation, furthering and development of data and knowledge sharing mechanisms holds a serious promise to foster socio-economic development in such countries. In the proposed applied research project (in Ethiopia, where agriculture is still the backbone of its society) we want to analyze (i) how OCS data and knowledge generation and sharing processes in four Communities of Practice in South(East) Ethiopia around soil fertilization are organized and how they vary; (ii) how governmental agricultural extension services and national scientists contribute to these processes; and (iii) pathways allowing the involved actors to link, strengthen and extend their knowledge hubs in Ethiopia and the further Horn of Africa. The research will be applied on seven CoP, who are involved in a continuous process of building and locally sharing knowledge on the production and application of organic fertilizers (including Bokashi and BioSpray). The farmers in the CoP are involved in coffee and grain production and use residues of their farms, together with cow dung, natural soil and rock dust to produce (fermented) organic fertilizers. MetaMeta and RockinSoils have been facilitating the strengthening of four of these CoP over the last two years having reached 700+ farmers . With this project farmers of an additional four CoP will be assisted by hands-on instruction courses to improve their fertilization experiments, while analyzing with PRA tools how results can be more effectively shared within their CoP, other CoPs in Ethiopia and beyond in the Horn of Africa using the OCSD network. As these results will be relevant for many other countries in the Global South, we anticipate that this research will clearly showcase how the OCSD Network can accelerate targeted development in its target countries.\nSimilarly, we anticipate to create significant spin-off in Ethiopia by furthering OCSD presence and visibility in Ethiopia. In particular MetaMeta will analyze how the seven CoP can link up to its other projects, including (i) the Ethiopian Climate Innovation Center (InfoDev Program of the World Bank); (ii) the University Water Sector Partnership Program, (iii) its 3R Network (www.bebuffered.com) and (iv) the facilitation of a cross-discipliner working group with soil and geo-microbiology experts. By linking the CoP’s with entrepreneurs and scientists we expect to have established a national knowledge hub by the end of the research project, which is able to facilitate and connect the knowledge development and sharing processes of soil fertility CoP’s around Ethiopia.\nIt is of importance to mention that we will assess workable data sharing mechanisms with involved scientists, who currently need to protect their data due to their publishing requirements in high impact journals. We will analyze with these scientists potential ‘ways out’, as well as discussing the option of this proposed OCSD research in our ongoing talks with CGIAR (Piers Bocock, Director of Knowledge management and communication), and UNESCO (Bhanu Neupane, Program specialist Open Access ICT & Sciences) for starting a project on developing a novel way of scientific impact assessment.  The outlook for funding that kind of work, especially by CGIAR, looks promising since CGIAR recently decided that all of their output should be published in open access journals and have asked us directly to discuss an approach for the development of novel systems for measuring the impact of open science. This soil science project could act as a pilot for the implementation of a new kind of evaluation system. \nIn the project as described above, Open Science and Open Access to research results form the key ingredients for a transformation to an innovative and sustainable way of doing science, which can be tapped in to by farmers from all CoP in Ethiopia AND at the same time for evaluating the impact of science in a way that reflects its real impact on society.  By publishing in open access journals or other open access media and collaborating online on topics of their choice in open collaborative scientific networks, communities of practice scientists and citizen scientists in the Global South have a unique opportunity to take the lead in the transformation of the way science is done and evaluated.', 'The project aims to analyze how the farmers in seven CoP can improve their knowledge building and sharing mechanisms on the production and application of Bokashi and BioSpray to raise the quality of crops in general, by using coffee as a prime example. An important part of the project focuses on training of farmers to improve and build capacity to test and monitor these products on their farms. The coffee farmers we will be working are located in SW and South Ethiopia (SNNPR and Gambelle Region). Being an actor ourselves in the CoP we will facilitate the farmers learning process on the role of: (i) air, water, minerals and the living organisms in and on the soil; (ii)Soil organic matter for moisture and nutrient storage; (iii) soil biological activity in mineralizing essential nutrients and feed for the crops; (iv) on farm organization of organic waste storage and processing.\n\nFirst phase: bringing science to the people. \nWe will start by evaluating available knowledge and knowledge gaps within the CoP and accordingly train its members on bio-fertility in sessions where we combine theory and practice on how to restore step by step the natural fertility of exhausted soils. We will focus on soil fertility and health and how this health can be achieved by using appropriated techniques. \nThe practical sessions can include specific examples regarding the elaboration and use of liquid fertilizers and mineral additives based on natural local inputs that are easily accessible for any producer.\n\nSecond phase: practical implementation of methods learned\nAfter following the practical sessions local workers will be able to process coffee pulp and other local waste streams to produce organic fertilizers. These fertilizers will be used on all 4 farms and a max of 50 ha per farm.\n\nThird phase: open science, building a community of practice\nIn this part of the project the following research questions will be addressed:\n• Insight in the impact of organic fertilizers on soil condition and its relation to coffee quality \n• Chemical and biological profiles of the soils in relation to soil fertility at the 4 CoP of the project.\n\nIn collaboration with local scientists (Addis Ababa and Arba Minch University) and practitioners samples taken from project farms will be analyzed and results will be shared with other agro-scientists and farmers on a dedicated soil science platform using the OCSD Network. Interpretation and discussion of the results will be done by the evolving open science community and the outcome will be openly available to all members of the OCSD community. The scientists will run themselves a parallel route (with CGIAR and UNESCO) on how data sharing mechanism and scientific evaluation mechanisms on performance can go hand-in-hand. \n\nFourth phase: Impact assessment and dissemination\nAfter the first year the impact of the project will be assessed in two ways\n• By measuring crop production and quality in the CoPs.\n• By assessing the use of the project’s protocols in other areas and countries as a result of communication through the OCSD network\n\nWe will also stimulate direct transmission of knowledge by creating opportunities for the local workers who received training in year 1 to share their knowledge and skills with other interested farmers in their region. For the second year we will basically repeat the 4 phase cycle involving other farmers and scientists. Where necessary we will provide guidance and practical help to farmers of the first year for organizing follow-up instruction courses.', 'As a direct practical result of the project farmers and local staff at the 4 coffee farms in Ethiopia will have learned to: a) process coffee pulp and other local waste streams to produce organic fertilizers, b) use specific methods to improve the soil condition and the coffee plant health to increase the fruits quality, c) use their acquired skills and knowledge on their own farms and teach others on how to copy their results.\n\nThe key outcome of the project will be the establishment of an online open science community of practice on soil fertility, using MetaMeta’s network in Ethiopia. Other members will be involved through the open science, open access, open development and other mailing list contacts of the OCDS Network.  This community will make use of the OCSD network infrastructure and contribute to its relevance by dissemination of development related knowledge in the area soil fertility, crop production and sustainable farming. More in particular, the network will serve to disseminate the results of the soil fertility experiments on the 7 CoPs in Ethiopia.\nThe discussions on the network will take place between community members from Ethiopia and other African countries. Community members will be a diverse group consisting of scientists and practitioners which will increase the focus on finding practical solutions.\nThe network will promote the sharing of science, from experimental design, real time monitoring and evaluation, up to the stage of data aggregation, interpretation and dissemination of results.\nThe OCSD soil science community can serve as an example for establishing open science communities in other disciplines on the OCSD network.\nAssessment of the direct impact of open science in the area of soil fertility will be possible by comparing crop production and quality of treated and non-treated plots of several farms within each CoP. Indirect effects will consist of increased practical and theoretical knowledge on the topic of sustainable farming, and sharing of this knowledge by the farmers and scientists with other local communities and through the OCSD network.\n\nPossibly this particular open science community can also serve as a test community for experimenting with a novel kind of community driven evaluation of the quality of scientific output. This will depend on the approval for a separate project between 2014-2016 at the CGIAR consortium on the evaluation of open science quality and impact, where one of us (Tom Olijhoek) will be involved. When the soil fertility community could be involved in the introduction and acceptance of a new system for scientific quality assessment, this would provide a real strong incentive for other scientists to adopt open science as the standard way to do science. \n\nScientifically, the project will provide more insight in the impact of organic fertilizers on soil condition and its relation to coffee quality. Analyses of soil samples and samples of produced fertilizers will produce chemical and biological profiles of the soils at the farms of the seven CoP of the project, which can be used to fine-tune fertilizer compositions for local conditions.', 'Year cycle for OCSD Soil Fertility project in Ethiopia 2015-2016 (figure)\n\nMonitoring and evaluation will vary according to the project phase. In the first phase the effectiveness of the courses will be evaluated through feedback from the farmers and their staff. Education materials will also be evaluated on the basis of feedback.\nThe second phase will be monitored by sampling of soil and fertilizer, analysis by a third party possibly Soil Food Web Laboratories, and interpretation of results with scientists and practitioners in Ethiopia.\nThe third phase of community building and information sharing will be evaluated for sharing efficiency by monitoring the number of people and countries represented in the soil fertility network on the OCSD platform and for dissemination and re-use by analyzing the use of the results in other projects and in other media including social media.\nThe fourth phase will allow us to evaluate the usefulness of the soil fertilization methods employed by measuring the quality of the produced crop (coffee), production volumes. It will possibly also allow us to test a new community driven way of evaluating scientific results and its effect on the willingness of other scientists to present their work using the OCSD soil fertility network. Success in this respect, whatever the figure will be, would mean that a new and more fair assessment system and direct contacts between scientists and practitioners could be the key for acceptance of open science methods by scientists in the countries of the Global South. \nThe cycle will be repeated for the second year with other farms in the same regions.', '77,883 Canadian Dollar', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/endorsement_letter_mm_050920141.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudget_soil_fertility1.xlsx', 159, 260, 'complete', 'yes', 1411160957, 'complete', '', '', 33, NULL, 'yes'),

It is commonly recognized that adaptation to climate change will require a coordinated action in multiple sectors and at multiple scales as well as public participation in the process.</p><p>A Model Forest is a unique multilevel governance structure which could be the type of flexible and adaptive platform that is needed to implement effective local solutions to tackle climate change. MFs are social initiatives through which a diversity of people and organizations work in partnership toward a common vision of the sustainable development of a forest-rich territory. In South America, Latin America, the Caribbean and Spain, there are currently 29 MFs located in 15 member countries.</p><p>At the landscape-level, the MF platforms represent a unique institutional context that nurtures a collaborative culture through multi-stakeholder processes. One of the key functions of MFs is to test new ideas and develop innovations, which makes them ideal platforms for our two case studies. MFs operate in &quot;networks&quot;, and networked collaboration is an important component of OCS.</p><p>At the regional level, the Ibero-American Model Forest Network (RIABM) connects all the platforms together, playing an essential role in facilitating public awareness and horizontal cooperation, promoting understanding and local action on complex issues, such as climate change. It is also a member of the International Model Forest Network, thereby serving as a bridge between the local and the global. MFs have already been used as platforms for the implementation of several research projects related to climate change.</p><p>One of such projects is CLIMIFORAD (Climate change, Ibero-American Mountain Forests and Adaptation), an initiative which aims at contributing to the regional climate adaptation process by improving the knowledge about the impacts on high mountain forest ecosystems (through modelling different climate change scenarios and impacts on different ecosystem and species) and by developing a series of tools to enhance forest management.</p><p>One of the main lessons learned during the four years of operation of the project is the need to collaborate further with the local actors, by engaging them into a collaborative, empowering research process. Therefore, this study is somehow meant to be the natural prolongation of the CLIMIFORAD project and to support a shift of focus during the rest of its lifecycle. We propose to use the data obtained through CLIMIFORAD and apply it within the existing Model Forest governance structures.</p><p>The idea is to bring the science to the people, by giving them the tools to analyze data and knowledge through appropriate capacity-building activities, and let them work out suitable responses, thereby stimulating an equitable and inclusive process of public participation and promoting citizen science into one of today&rsquo;s biggest challenges: climate change. Purpose of the Study. The short term goal of this research is to find out how rural communities and individual citizens can be involved in pre-existing projects whose design is mostly conventional (such as CLIMIFORAD). In other words, how can we combine a traditional research design with a dynamic and interactive OCS process, in which local actors step in and determine the way to go? What are the enabling conditions for the meaningful involvement of citizens in the research process?</p><p>This study intends to address a mix of questions related to several themes, especially theme 3 (understanding better the open science communities of actors and institutional contexts to increase inclusiveness) and 4 (evidence of impacts). A systematic framing of the research questions will occur during project planning and could evolve during the actual research process. The study would be mainly exploratory in nature and may be shaped by the actors in the territories.</p><p>The observation of the process will be key and allow us to gather interesting insights to inspire future actions. For instance, it will be interesting to observe how CLIMIFORAD scientists contribute to and are influenced by the communities or &ldquo;landscape learning&rdquo; throughout the OCS process.</p><p>The overarching goal is to achieve transformative participation of citizens in scientific debates, research agenda setting, data interpretation, and knowledge production in relation with climate change. More specifically, to find pathways through which communities can successfully design and adopt their own tools to adapt to and monitor climate change.</p><p>To this end, we will seek to establish an interactive relationship between scientific knowledge (through CLIMIFORAD) and an innovative local governance framework (the Model Forest platform). The ultimate development goal is to build the adaptive capacity of interconnected socio- ecological systems in order to reach sustainability.</p>', '<p>The study combines: &bull; An integrated landscape management approach, closely tied to the Model Forest (MF) concept. We will aim at having the largest number possible of sectors and stakeholders represented in the study in order to find common solutions to diverse needs.</p><ul><li>The method developed by IPCC (2007) to analyze vulnerability, which is used by CLIMIFORAD. It takes into account three major components (exposition, sensitivity, adaptive capacity) to determine potential impacts.</li></ul><p>The hypothesis is that social platforms such as MFs help enhancing climate change mitigation and adaptation and that through the analysis of scientific data, local actors are able to establish concrete strategies (with objectives, actions, responsibilities) at different scales and levels: parcels, sectors, communities, territories. The study will be performed in two MF landscapes where CLIMIFORAD research is being conducted. It will be mainly geared toward citizens and community representatives directly involved in ecosystem services and natural resource use that could be affected by climate change (wood, water, pasture, etc.).</p><p>First, we will provide MF stakeholders with general facts about climate change issues and with specific vulgarized scientific data, as well as examples and scenarios of how this knowledge may affect them and the development of their landscapes. Emphasis will be placed on knowledge related to the most critical issues for the territory, such as availability of water or the risk of disasters like droughts or inundations or the spread of pests/diseases. The actors will be introduced to major adaptation and mitigation techniques.</p><p>The second step will be to have the stakeholders of the Model Forests analyze data and scenarios produced by CLIMIFORAD and come up with conclusions about impacts on their livelihoods and concrete solutions. The workshop will be designed in such a manner that local actors will take the lead of the process. Key aspects such as traditional knowledge, perceptions and behaviors could be examined in more detail.

At the same time, it aims at creating awareness among scientists and policy-makers on the role that communities can play and on the appropriate methods and attitudes needed in order to achieve effective and equitable climate governance.</p><p>Our assumption is that Model Forests (MFs) have the potential to strike a good balance between scientific expertise and the participation of a community of non-experts in the management of natural resources. Expected development outcomes are, among others:</p><p>- Through capacity-building, the project will buildawareness in the communities concerning anthropogenic climate change and the urgent need to implement adaptation measures.</p><p>- It will increase the visibility and impact of scientific research at the local level, fostering public engagement and new community-based and -led thinking by encouraging citizens to seek intellectual development and apply scientific knowledge to decision-making.</p><p>- It will therefore empower citizens and enhance their trust in scientists or at least reduce the gap between &ldquo;experts&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-experts&rdquo;. In certain case it could help creating fruitful bonds between the scientific community and civil society. Thus, the project would enhance the culture of collaboration, knowledge-sharing and consensus-building that already exists within MFs and contribute to the creation of new social capital.</p><p>- Researchers will themselves develop new methodological skills, attitudes and behaviors to work in partnership with communities in an open and collaborative fashion.</p><p>- The project will improve adaptive capacity of communities. It should contribute to strengthening climate governance within MFs and lead to a better understanding of the interactions between governments, citizens, communities, academia and organizations in a unique open collaborative process.</p><p>- Another possible important outcome would be to improve future policies through dissemination of the OCS approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Policy impact is hard to predict but not impossible given that governmental authorities are involved in the MF governance structure. Concerning the relevance of the research, most of the outcomes are directly aligned with overall OCSDNet objectives and the research helps responding to many questions outlined in the call. For instance it could help bringing to light the obstacles to engage further in open science, highlight pitfalls and the role of leadership.</p><p>Comparison of the results in the two MF should bring interesting insights on how the knowledge creation processes of OCS differ in varying local contexts. It could also reveal the key characteristics of governance architecture needed for an effective OCS process, by comparing results with other case studies based on totally different institutional contexts. The study will help to determine ways in which the academia and citizens can collaborate successfully and engage together in climate change adaptation. It will also reveal how scientists can adopt new, open practices, thereby supporting OCSDNet&rsquo;s stated goal of understanding better how the next generation of researchers can be trained to practice and value OCS.</p><p>The proposed research will therefore contribute significantly to the theory of change and the processual research strand outlined in OCSDNet Background Paper.</p>', '<p>Project design and the quality and relevance of materials and activities will be subject to an ongoing evaluation by the research team to make changes along the way and also in order to integrate participants inputs.</p><p>After each workshop, feedback would be obtained from participants through an evaluation form and personal communications. Questions such as the following could be asked:</p><ol><li>Do people really feel they are involved?</li><li>What are their motivations for participating?</li><li>Do they feel the group is representative and inclusive?</li><li>Did they find the workshop useful? etc.</li></ol><p>During the last session, all participants will be asked to evaluate the whole process. Success of the project in general will also be evaluated in an open, participatory manner during the final wrap-up workshop. This will include a collective, critical analysis of the process and definition of outcomes. Outcomes will be assessed through the &ldquo;Outcome Harvesting&rdquo; method to determine meaningful success of the research (are there more positive than negative outcomes?).</p><p>Another indicator of meaningful success will be the perceived results of the project by the citizens, scientists and other stakeholders involved and their level of satisfaction regarding the process. Unexpected outcomes will also be analysed. The researchers will also make their own evaluation exercise and seek to measure certain aspects by developing a basic series of indicators at the beginning of the projects.</p><p>Particular attention will be given to the OCS process: o its representativeness, by reference to a stakeholder analysis (are all relevant stakeholders involved?) o its inclusiveness in terms of special attention given to traditionally marginalized groups, but also to traditional knowledge o its openness (can anyone participate to the OCS process, how &quot;open&quot; is it?) o its effectiveness (objectives have been met? Is collaboration successful?) o Etc.</p><p>The strategies and recommendations elaborated by the stakeholders could be compared to strategies highlighted in the scientific literature, in order to evaluate if the OCS process generated coherent, relevant and locally-taillored adaptation strategies or even new strategies. A critical analysis of the whole research project will be performed against a series of parameters or questions elaborated to match OCSDNet objectives.</p><p>The evaluation would be at the basis of the final report. Finally, the replicability of the OCS initiative should be addressed (costs, length, contextual barriers, etc.). Certain potential long-term outcomes and impacts (for example, effective adaptation to climate change or policy influence) can be taken into consideration, but unfortunately largely fall outside of the scope of this project.</p><p>The research tema is also willing to contribute to reporting requirements or the monitoring strategy established by OCSDNet team and open to new ideas and collaborate with other project teams during the workshop in Nairobi.</p>', '79.453', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/RIABM-CATIE_Endorsement_Letter.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/8sept-OCSDNetBudget-RIABM-CATIE.xlsx', 124, 254, 'complete', 'yes', 1411481706, 'complete', 'In principle the project looks very interesting and maybe it illustrates one sort of strategic approach that could be developed to engage the scientific communities, or at least individual researchers, in open collaborative science projects, who might be starting from conventional approaches to science.

All of them has been engaged in developing National Cleaner Production Policy for AGRICULTURE sector and plantation sector.', 'Poverty Alleviation among vulnerable social groups in Rural Sri Lanka through introduction of Environmentally Sustainable Technologies using low carbon fuel resources', 'Sri Lanka', 'Moneragala District is 2nd poorest district in the country though rich in agro resources. This district has more than 2000 single female parent families living in extreme poverty. These females are left behind by their spouses due to various reasons leaving the burden of raising the children to the females. These females are rural and uneducated with minimum schooling. The project will be carried out in “Siyabalanduma” division, one division with 500 identified females who have formed into 27women societies. However due to their level of income and lack of collateral, none of the financial institutes are willing to provide any loans for starting a business. Besides they do not have access to the markets to sell their products.\n\nThe selected district produce paddy in large quantities which result in a large  quantity of paddy husk as waste agricultural biomass (WAB) which is either burned or allowed to naturally decay. Since the waste agricultural biomass was not included in any category there is no responsible person or authority to manage the waste and no formal action was taken by the Government, NGO or any other enterprise. In 2009, National Cleaner Production Centre (NCPC) together with United nations Environmental Program (UNEP) initiated a project to quantify and assess the final fate of the waste and develop technologies  to use them as a low cost low carbon fuel in the region. A pilot project was carried out using WAB to develop a drier and a appropriate stove to smoke/dry lime fruit. NCPC could not attempt further research of the technology due to non availability of funds after 2010. During this pilot project it was found that a large number of women’s societies need community driers to support their members to make a living. This research aims on further investigation of low carbon thermal technologies to enhance the living standards of the rural women using the local resources.\n\nThe proposed research is to empower women through their societies to collect agricultural produce in the region during surplus season and value add to them using technologies  which operate on thermal energy generated from waste paddy husk. \n\nThe research will be acarried out to support 25 community based women organizations having at least 500 members in total. The project will fabricate and deliver 25 nos of small scale food driers which can process 100-200kgs of raw fruit/vegetable in one batch. Through this it is expected to value add to at least 40/50 tons per month of wasted harvest into processed agro products. The products will be initially sold in a supermarket chain with about 200 outlets. The stoves of the drier will be operated with waste agricultural biomass (paddy husk) which was open burned previously. \n\nThe project must demonstrate outstanding innovation in contributing towards social impact and climate change mitigation goals. Innovation may be demonstrated from the use of new products, new services, new business models, new approaches, new technologies, or application of old products, old services, old business model, old approaches, in a new, innovative way. The innovation should be transformative, with strong potential for scalability. \n\nThe project will use a newly developed fruit/vegetable drier and new stove using paddy husk in area where there is no electricity for operations. The equipment will be adaptable to different raw products from season to season without any major changes and will be simple to operate. It will make several new food products for the market and will use an innovative approach to reach the end customers by using a large super market chain. The project will benefit organized social groups instead of individuals and facilitate use of waste agri biomass as a renewable fuel.\n\nThe project will have three major positive impacts on environmental sustainability and climate change. The project will reduce the waste of valuable agricultural produce which are in excess during seasons thus reducing the solid wastes generated and avoid natural decay of organic raw materials. It will also reduce the open burning part of waste agricultural biomass (paddy husk) in the field causing heavy dust and smoke. The project will avoid use of petroleum fuels in the project are for industrial use thus reducing the emission of GHGs. The negative impact is the emission of dust and smoke from combustion of paddy husk in the stoves, but through controlled burning and preventive measures installed in the equipment this will be eliminated.', 'The proposed research firstly would identify the suitable recepients of the project among target group. And then identify the exact resource availability to be utilised by developed technology. The size of the propesed dryer will be determined accordingly. \n\nCapacity building programes will be conducted to Identified communities to develop their entreprenuel skills. A resource map will be developed to conduct the propesed research. Technology will be developed with reseach collaborators to fabricate and deliver 25 nos of small scale food driers which can process 100-200kgs of raw fruit/vegetable in one batch. \n\nOnce the marketability of the products is established by this project, the other societies will be encouraged to start similar business with the supported light engineering firms becoming the local fabricator of equipment and local banks /micro finance orgs to finance these small businesses. The partners of this project will continue to support the business development for new entrants.\n\nIt is expected to broaden this approach to the entire province where the total number of deprived and poor women exceed 5000 in number and upscale to cover at least 5 rural districts which are in the bottom of the per capita income generation. The up scaling will based on the availability of resources and marketability as well as availability of fuel source (usually this is not a problem). The project expects to develop two small scale light engineering workshop in the fabrication of the equipment and this will be expanded to cover at least 50 light engineering/ fabrication workshop.', 'The project will be carried out in one province, one divisional secretariat division.

The stoves of the drier will be operated with waste agricultural biomass (paddy husk) which was open burned previously. The units will operate 9 months per year (3 months rainy season not considered suitable for operation) using seasonal fruits/vegetable in turn. This operation will bring 60 US$ to 180 per member per month. \n\nBy the end of first year reduced waste of agricultural produce by processing is expected to be 360 tons. Number of women member benefitted to be out of poverty will be around 500.

The proposed research will employ a critical approach to Participatory Action Research methodologies utilised in the context of examining the value and recognition of indigenous knowledge within climate change adaptation strategies. This research will address questions surrounding whether the outputs of OCS lead to a better understanding of local development issues and more autonomous decision making, in this case the influence of the Khoi on climate change adaptation initiatives.</p><p>Through its methodologies described in section C4, this research will also examine the power relations between researchers and communities, and whether the PAR and feedback loop sessions reinforce or reconfigure power relations between researchers, communities and policy makers.</p><p>Climate change is recognized as one of the world&rsquo;s greatest human development challenges, and the need to adapt to its impacts is acknowledged by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Vulnerability to climate impacts varies between regions and social groups, and people who are marginalized are especially vulnerable both to climate impacts but also to inappropriate responses.</p><p>A recent UNFCCC report highlights that existing approaches may not incorporate indigenous knowledge (IK) sufficiently into adaptation initiatives and that communities also face risks and challenges sharing their IK. Meaningful engagement frameworks and appropriate legal frameworks to protect IK are required. This research project responds to the problem that climate change, intellectual property, and IK have each been normatively constructed through &ldquo;naturalized&rdquo; discourses that prevent more meaningful understanding of them individually and how they relate to one another. Such an understanding is imperative for developing more just responses to adapt to climate change and its impact on indigenous peoples.</p><p>In response to these normative conceptions, this research project re-conceptualizes climate change, intellectual property, and IK as products of political, economic, and socio-cultural histories. This allows for a more robust examination of their relationship to one another in order to develop more complex strategies and legal reforms when reacting to climate change impacts on indigenous peoples.</p><p>The relationship between intellectual property (IP) laws and policies and indigenous knowledge-based strategies is complex, and it remains highly controversial whether conventional or sui generis IP models are best suited for appropriately protecting and managing IK systems in African settings. In order to enrich the current debate and provide practical advice to the Khoi, this project will develop an IP Regulatory Universe that captures and describes the pertinent IP laws and policies for holders of indigenous knowledge systems in South Africa, analyse the theoretical and on-the ground impacts of the legal instruments identified, and explore appropriate &ndash; formal and informal - IK management strategies for the Khoi people.</p><p>This research project responds to the interrelated issues of intellectual property, climate change, and indigenous knowledge by developing a political, ecological approach through participatory action research methods. In doing so, it focuses on three inter-related objectives.</p><p>The first is to empower Khoi peoples to assess the following:</p><p>(i) how climate change has impacted their communities;</p><p>(ii) how their indigenous knowledge offers adaptation strategies;</p><p>(iii) and what types of laws and policies, including intellectual property rights, promote and/or hinder these strategies?</p><p>The second is to re-conceptualize climate change, intellectual property, and indigenous knowledge not as inevitable environmental changes, natural property rights, or traditional (i.e. less valuable) ways of knowing. But rather to understand them in relation to each other in an interdisciplinary way as structured by political, economic, and socio-cultural histories pertaining to indigenous peoples.</p><p>The third is to enable the Khoi to develop their own protocols through participatory action research methods to produce such re-conceptualizations in order to build indigenous peoples&rsquo; capacity for social change and to adapt to climate change. This research is important, as OCS could potentially impact upon indigenous peoples right to self-determination, and thus safeguards such as prior, informed consent to the research process and PAR are required.</p>', '<p>This project is guided and informed by a methodological understanding of climate change through a political, ecological approach as a product not only of environmental changes, but also of political, economic, and socio-cultural histories. A particular set of research techniques and methods are thus required that can enable such an understanding, in particular, as it concerns histories of climate change and knowledge governance related to the Khoi.</p><p>To accomplish this, the project deploys participatory action research (PAR) as a set of research strategies and techniques. PAR aims to reduce the power relations within and between researchers/researched and hierarchies of knowledge production by involving marginalized groups within the design, implementation, and outcomes of the research.</p><p>PAR takes a bottom-up approach by developing partnerships with communities to identify key issues of importance and develop ways of doing research, interpret results, and take action on the findings. This enables the research to better respond to the interests and needs of the community in ways that benefit them. Because it also aims to disrupt hierarchies of knowledge production it also enables participants to conceptually challenge normative understandings of climate change and knowledge governance as ahistorical and value-neutral and how such conceptions have material consequences for indigenous peoples.</p><p>PAR is not without its limitations however, and it requires continual and ongoing reflexivity on the research process itself and on the positionality of participants in ways that attend to the relative structures and hierarchies of power at issue.</p><p>To ensure more meaningful PAR methods, feedback loop sessions will be incorporated into the research design and implementation, to assess whether PAR is meeting its goals and what factors and relations of power may be constraining the project.</p><p>This project will be implemented through seven specific research activities as follows:</p><p>1. Community networking and introduction of the project to the community.</p><p>2. Capacity building Khoi youth. The capacity of Khoi youth will be built in the areas of climate change, adaptation responses and PAR in the context of IK in climate change, so they are equipped with a deep understanding of the project and its objectives, and additional knowledge and skills.</p><p>3. PAR with Khoi youth as co-investigators. The researchers together with the Khoi youth will carry out PAR in the wider Khoi community. The focus will be to discover current impacts of climate change upon community livelihoods, and to identify IK of particular relevance to climate change adaptation. PAR will include a peer-to-peer learning exchange between the Khoi youth and key representatives from the community with a Nama community, whose livelihoods are based upon traditional stock farming and who are facing challenges due to climate change.</p><p>4. Policy analysis and implications for community climate change strategies. In parallel to the PAR process, the principal researchers will conduct desktop research and carry out interviews with key informants to examine what types of laws and policies (including intellectual property rights) promote and/or hinder community adaptation strategies. The findings will be distilled into community-accessible formats, and a workshop held so the community can consider the implications, and strategize on possible options regards their IK in climate change.</p><p>5. Analysis of PAR results and new knowledge production. The investigators will analyse the results of PAR, the policy analysis and community responses to it, and author papers synthesizing these elements and reflecting on the findings.</p><p>6. Advocacy. The Khoi youth and community representatives will be facilitated through an advocacy process, where they will decide whether to raise awareness regards their IK in climate change adaptation at the municipal, provincial, national and international levels (UNFCCC). Where necessary, the researchers will support them to engage with appropriate stakeholders and platforms.</p><p>7. Evaluation See section C6 for further details. The design and methodologies are supportive of OCSDNet as they are directly relevant to Theme 4. This project will conduct action research together with community members, and the Feedback Loop Sessions will enable the researchers to examine whether the PAR approach is reconfiguring the typical power relations between researcher and community.</p><p>Furthermore community representatives, will also be trained in their rights, and facilitated through a process where they will decide how best to utilise the knowledge produced and through meetings with government, experts and practitioners, there will be opportunity to begin to influence climate change adaptation policies and initiatives. These processes and outcomes will also be documented and evaluated to determine aspects such as whether they are altering power relations and deepening the understanding of developmental issues.</p>', '<p>The project will conceptualize climate change, intellectual property, and indigenous knowledge so they are better understood in relation to each other in an interdisciplinary way as structured by the political, economic and socio-cultural histories of the Khoi peoples.

(34, 'The Principal Investigator used to head an international IDRC project team a few years ago with the project on "The Role of Universities in Information Technology for Development in Asia (IDRC Grant no. 103690-001). The purpose of that project was to find out how the role of universities in South-east Asia could affect or enhance the use of ICT in development. The project consisted of members from Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, China and the US. The project started in 2005 and ended in 2007. \n\nThe present project is highly interdisciplinary and clearly shows the spirit of open and collaborative science.

Thus it corresponds with Theme One in the Call. Thailand presents a challenging case for this type of analysis because it is on the one hand deeply traditional, with almost all its pre-modern institutions surviving intact to the present day, and on the other hand the country is perceiving itself as a modern one which is trying to integrate itself into the globalized modern economy. The proposed study aims at analyzing the difficult challenges that this tension poses for the case of Thailand, making use of Institutional Analysis and Development framework (IAD), which is concerned with “outlining a systematic approach for analyzing institutions that govern action and outcomes within collective action arrangements” (Ostrom, 2007, 44). The challenges come in various dimensions, including, but possibly not limited to, social, cultural, historical, institutional and political ones. \n\nDevelopment Challenge \n\nThailand’s status as a hybrid country where the old and the new coexist, sometimes clashing with each other with disastrous results, as is currently the case in the political troubles that the country is now facing. However, Thailand’s hybridity could be turned to be a strong point for open and collaborative science with the right understanding and the right tools. It is the objective of the proposed study to identify such tools.\n\nIn other words, the development challenge is centered around the question how best to reconcile the old and the new in such a country as Thailand. For example, the educational system is still very much tied up with the need for creating a unified nation, a task that should have been completed more than a century ago. However, the force of inertia is such that even now in the twenty-first century many in Thailand are still grappling with the issue. The success of open and collaborative science in Thailand in general thus depends very much on a clear understanding of this challenge as well as seeing a clearer path out of the difficulty.\n\nOverall Context \n\nThailand is now standing at a critical point in its history. The current development is such that the country could go either down the path of a “failed state,” where almost none of its institutions fail to function, or it could remove all these shackles and become a full fledged member of the international community. We believe that the promotion of open and collaborative science could be a key factor in turning Thailand to the right direction. \n\nRationale and Significance \n\nIn order to meet the development challenge specified above, it is proposed that a systematic study of the role of open and collaborative science (OCS) for development within the Thai context be conducted. The overall question is whether and if so how OCS could promote well balanced development. The question is important because studies have shown that OCS has the potential to promote the growth of science itself and as science is directly related to development, then OCS should have a role to play in development too. However, in a hybrid culture such as the Thai one this may not be as straightforward. Thus this represents a challenge and a rationale for the proposed study. The lesson learned in the Thai case can be studied, modified and adopted in other related cases too. There is currently a dearth of detailed studies that specifically look at various possible factors that either promote or inhibit more integration of open and collaborative practices into the lifeworld of the people, both lay and professional. It is believed that the proposed study here could fill this lacuna and help us understand more how culture and tradition function as a necessary factor in an attempt to find out how the practice of open and collaborative science is to be integrated into the daily lives of the people.  \n\nThe study thus fits with Theme One of the Call for Concept Papers. The logical relationships among the various components of the call are as follows: The overall context provides a basis or a framework within which the whole project lies. In particular it gives rise to the research questions, as well as provides a basis for their rationale and significance. At the same time it gives rise to the development challenge. The development challenge in turns provides material for the rationale and significance of the research questions. In the end, the research questions are designed to orient the whole project to meet the development challenge.', 'The methodologies to be used in the project consist of documentary research, conceptual investigation, focus group interviews and questionnaires. The main focus will be on conceptual investigation and documentary research, as the main objective of the study is not to investigate what is already there, but identifying both the factors inhibiting and those that promote the growth of open and collaborative science. This is not something that already exists in such a way as a researcher can empirical examine it, but it represents something that is only exists conceptually, because open and collaborative science has not been promoted or implemented in Thailand on any scale yet. As the overall aim of the OCSD project is to find out whether, and if so how, open and collaborative science could contribute to development (in its various dimensions), the proposed study aims at contributing to this by focusing on the theory building aspect of the problem. More specifically, we aim at identifying factors that inhibit and those that promote the practice of open and collaborative science, especially within the context of a hybrid country such as Thailand. It is quite commonly believed that open and collaborative science has a potential of promoting scientific knowledge in general. The proposed study aims at further investigating this claim through the experiences garnered from the research conducted in the study. \n\nThe theoretical part of the study will be conducted through close reading of the relevant texts and of the transcripts of the interviews of key players in the field, as well as transcripts of focus group meetings. The texts will consist not only of published literature in the area (there are very few at the moment), but also of those texts that are not intended to focus mainly on the role of open and collaborative science as a tool for development in the Global South, such as the theoretical ones by Ostrom and others. The close reading method is usually employed in the humanities, especially in literary studies where meanings that lie “between the lines” are uncovered and presented to the research community. These hidden meanings are not mere speculations or guesswork on the part of the researcher, as the latter has to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the community that the uncovered meanings have to be coherent with other contextual clues and agree with the objective aspects of the system. The close reading of texts will form the main part of the study, and will be supplemented by the more usual social scientific methods of interviews and meetings.  \n\nSo the design of the project is broken down as follows: In the first four months an extensive review of the relevant literature will be conducted. During this period an introductory meeting of all the participants in the project will be held so that everybody knows exactly what is expected of them. Then the project will be divided into smaller tasks and distributed to each of the participants. As the team members come from a varied background, the task will be divided roughly into the theoretical part and those that are based on the institutions that a member finds himself or herself in. This part of the research will be more empirical and consists of interviews and focus group meetings. The aim is to find out attitudes among the members of the organization who are not part of the project toward open and collaborative science as well as their views on the possible obstacles and supporting points. Then after one year the team will get together formally again to share their results and get feedback from each other. Then in the second year of the project, the process will be repeated again, resulting in the main outcomes of the project.', 'Expected outcomes include an understanding, for the case of Thailand, factors that inhibit the growth and promotion of open and collaborative science as well as those that support it. The outcome will meet the development challenge specified earlier, which is how to find, if possible, the optimal way to make use of Thailand’s hybridity in such a way as the ideas behind open and collaborative science become a tool for development. As such, then, the project is a theoretical one in that it does not directly address a specific challenge such as food security or better quality education; nonetheless, it addresses a more fundamental set of concerns which must be met before any attempt at addressing these specific concerns could get off the ground. \n\nMore specific outcomes include a series of workshops and seminars designed to engage the public on the ideas of open and collaborative science. There will also be a project website and a number of leaflets and brochures.  \n\nAs for policy relevance, the project will invite members of the public research organizations, faculty members from universities, and others who have stakes in policy formulation in science and technology to attend. In fact many members of the proposed project are already involved in these policy formulating processes in science and technology in Thailand. As open and collaborative science is a new concept, there needs to be a time lapse before an adequate number of those who could push forward the new policy to appreciate its usefulness. That perhaps would be concretized after the final completion of the project; however, when these people are invited to get involved in the project from the beginning as observers and audience who are asked to provide feedback, then they would be already familiar with the findings and the basic concepts of the project by the time they formalize the findings as a new policy for the government. \n\nOn the other side, we also aim to engage the general public actively, especially through one member of the team who is active in a non-governmental organization. The idea of ‘citizen science’ will be discussed with the public and we foresee that independent citizen science projects could be launched through the public’s own initiatives without waiting for formal government policy formulation. Thus, the strategy will be a two-pronged one where both the government and the public are engaged at the same time.', 'It is proposed that a team of external reviewers be set up to monitor and evaluate the project. These can be Thai citizens who have no conflict of interest with the project, or the IDRC could send their representatives in the region to visit and talk with the project leaders. Based on the experiences of the project leaders, this is a very good way at monitoring the project. It is at least better than mere submission of document reports which can be dry and does not provide an opportunity for face-to-face meetings where questions can be answered immediately and directly. The external reviewers can be invited and appointed soon after the start of the project so that they can follow the project in its entirety. The evaluation team will have access to all the documents of the project and can be involved in the public meetings if they so wish. \n\nMeasure of success or failure of the project include: (1) whether the project satisfactorily answers all the questions specified especially those related to identifying the factors for open and collaborative science for development in Thailand, based on technical academic review; (2) whether the meetings and seminars achieve their stated objectives, based on external review and examination of reports; (3) whether the project could generate networking among researchers in the same field worldwide, based on comments and social networking on the project website.', '79,945 CAD', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/Letter_of_Endorsement_-_OCSD1.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudget-8Sep14.xlsx', 101, NULL, 'complete', 'yes', 1410181644, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, 'yes');

She has demonstrated significant science leadership in the field of spatial science, landscape ecology and mapping of ecosystem services and led the innovative design and application of scientific spatial tools and indices that have helped shape natural and cross-cultural resource management projects that she has been involved with.\n•Publications: 12 peer-reviewed ISI journal articles, 5 of which were first authored; 6 co-authored book chapters (58 ISI citations since 2013, h-index of 5) and co-authored 31 technical reports, 16 of these since 2010.\n•In 2008 she led MTSRF 1.2.1 Project Status and Trends of Wet Tropics Biodiversity & Ecosystem Services: state of the environment reporting and gap filling, an externally funded project with an overall budget of $158K. Collaborating with external stakeholders she successfully led and managed this research project, which involved managing a team of 3 research scientists and the delivery of milestone reports in a timely manner. Additionally she was the lead author of the final Prototype Report Card and developed an innovative composite threat index to assess biodiversity condition in the Wet Tropics and published the results in the journal Ecological Indicators. \n•Dr Pert is currently leading the scientific spatial analyses and development of socio economic indicators for an extensive $2 million study for three years, which involves a collaboration between CSIRO’s Wealth from Oceans Flagship, the National Environment Research Program, JCU, and the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. More recently she has led the primary data capture component, which has involved surveying 5,000 locals, tourists and businesses about how they use, relate and value the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and where they go.  \n•Dr Pert has been heavily involved in this GBR project (i.e. 50% of her time) which has involved her establishing an innovative way of capturing primary data by using 35 iPads with a iSurvey app for staff to use whilst out in the field, reducing the time needed for data input and improved efficiencies for subsequent analyses.  Additionally, Dr Pert has shown innovation in leading and developing a spatial Collaborative Habitat Investment Atlas tool. This tool has enabled Terrain NRM and local community organizations at Mission Beach to stop development on blocks containing the necessary habitat for the endangered Southern Cassowary. NRM managers now have a tool that provides spatial visualization and evidence of areas of high biodiversity and high levels of threat so that they are able to prioritize investments of resources and understand where to spatially allocate these resources within the landscape.  \n•Recognized scientist internationally demonstrated through collaborations with international scientists developing a blueprint for ecosystem services assessment studies. Also Dr Pert is an active member of the Ecosystem Services Partnership and was invited to co-supervise a University of Kiel, Germany masters student.\n•Adjunct Research Fellow with James Cook University and co-supervisor of a PhD student looking at ecosystem services in Queensland’s wet tropics forests in the face of climate change.', 'Spatial interactions between natural, human, and built capital to value the storm protection services of coastal wetlands', 'Cambodia, Australia, Indonesia, Fiji, Mexico - global south', 'Human well-being results from the interaction of built, social, human, and natural capital. Ecosystem services are the relative contribution of natural capital to human well-being; however, this flow occurs through interactions with human, social, and built capital. The storm protection services provided by coastal wetlands exemplify how spatial interactions between natural and built capital control much of their contribution to human well-being. Wetlands in close proximity to urbanized areas provide more storm protection services than remote wetlands. Coastal wetlands on the eastern seaboard of the United States reduce the damaging effects of hurricanes on coastal communities by approximately 23 billion dollars per year (Costanza et. al. 2007). This project will build on previous work in several important ways; it will: 1) be global in scope, 2) consider lives saved in addition to economic value, 3)  incorporate a wider array of spatial context variables, 4) investigate systematic approaches to characterizing spatial interaction mechanisms.\n\nThe importance of this work is threefold:  (a) theory building with respect to spatial interactions between natural capital and built capital as it pertains to increasing human well-being, (b) providing tools to inform and impact policy regarding the value of coastal wetlands, and (c) producing global datasets representing natural, built, and human capital. Earlier work involving valuation of storm protection services of coastal wetlands in the U.S. involved researchers scattered on three continents collaborating via e-mail. OCSD provides the ideal vehicle from which to disseminate data products, web mapping, and analysis tools that result from this work. \nThis research proposal particularly addresses the 2nd theme "Infrastructure and Technologies" and 3. Communities of Practice.', 'Proposed Activities:\n1.Data Identification and Assembly\nPhysical and Natural Capital Data: The spatial resolution, classification methods and accuracy, and availability of coastal wetland data around the world represent a challenging data assembly and integration task.  This team will consider issues associated with classification (e.g. emergent herbaceous wetlands vs. mangroves vs. estuaries vs. marshes vs. bogs), spatial resolution and accuracy, data models, etc. with respect to producing an integrated dataset that will feed into the analysis environment we develop. Our primary source data will be global in coverage. We will use the global wetland data available here (http://www.wwfus.org/science/data.cfm). For mangrove data we will use the UNEP data here (http://datadownload.unep-wcmc.org/datasets). We will also obtain elevation and bathymetry data to incorporate various water volume and elevation gradient measures into the statistical analysis.\nBuilt and Human captial Data: We will assemble actual and modeled disaggregate economic activity (GDP/km2) data derived from several nighttime lights studies and other ancillary information. We will apply these methods to the newly available nighttime lights imagery derived from the VIIRS platform (http://npp.gsfc.nasa.gov/viirs.html).  Landscan will be used to represent population distribution.\nStorm Track and Damage Data: The following information must be assembled: 1) spatio-temporal paths of the storms with associated wind speeds, temperatures, and Safir-Simpson categories (available here: http://www.grid.unep.ch/data/gnv199.php ), 2) actual and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjusted dollar damages caused by the storm, and 3) lives lost. This data will be assembled from historical public and private records.  \nThe assembling and cataloging of these datasets is not only important to this analysis, but will also serve future studies as well.  Datasets of natural, built, and human capital as well as derived results will be made available for web download as part of the final products of the working group.  The challenging technical issues associated with classification, measurement scale, and spatial resolution will be greatly facilitated and expedited by face-to-face interactions at proposed workshops.\n2. Calculate a dollar value of coastal wetlands for storm protection as a function of spatial context and storm characteristics  \nThe dollar value of the storm protection services provided by a coastal wetland is highly dependent on spatial context.  We will estimate how value varies with location, area of remaining wetlands, proximity to built infrastructure, storm probability, and elevation and bathymetric variation. Due to the fundamentally geographic nature of this project, the landfall of each hurricane/typhoon/cyclone requires a unique spatial analysis to extract the data that is incorporated into the regression analysis. This is an ideal example of the stochastic nature of the spatial interactions between fixed natural and built capital as they exist relative to the probability surface of a dynamic weather phenomena. The data needed to build the tables used for statistical analysis require inputs from literally hundreds of spatial analyses. For each hurricane/typhoon/cyclone swath, multiple geographical information systems (GIS) operations—such as, clipping, buffering, extracting, and summarizing are applied, each requiring GIS programming. A spatial analysis and data extraction team will work with the other teams to expedite these analyses and insure overall consistency, as well as understanding of the benefits and limitations of results. \nSpatial analysis includes but is not limited to the following:\n• Buffered  hurricane tracks\n• Hurricane ‘swaths’ created by overlaying buffer on coastline\n• Wetlands clipped by ‘swath’ with wetlands data\n• Dollars in ‘swath’ are a clipped feature of the ‘swath’ with disaggregate GDP \n• Population in ‘swath’ clipped from Landscan population density data\n• Generation of category specific storm frequency maps from storm track data\nRegression analysis includes but is not limited to the following: \n• Multiple regression analysis using relative damages as the dependent variable and wind speed, wetland area, and other independent variables\n• Estimates of annual value of wetlands for storm protection derived using above multiple  regression analysis, combined with the data on annual hurricane frequency.\n• Multiple regression analysis using lives lost as the dependent variable and population density,  wetlands, and storm intensity and frequency information as the dependent variables.\n•  Estimates of annual number of lives saved from storm protection using relationships derived from the regression analyses, combined   with the data on annual hurricane frequency. \nIn summary, the economic value of the storm protection services provided by each pixel of wetland is a geographical and mathematical function of:  \n1) Storm probabilities\n2) Local economic activity \n3) Local wetlands in area.  \n3. Apply the regression models developed in Activity #2 to the spatial datasets to produce maps of the estimated dollar value of storm protection services and lives saved.', 'A key result of this work is the characterization of the nature of the spatial interactions between built and natural capital in general. As a case study we will examine and document the importance of geographical context on the valuation of storm protection services as they pertain to coastal wetlands; however,  we will identify ways in which these methods can be applied to the valuation of other ecosystem services. Spatially explicit valuation of an ecosystem service can be highly dependent on scale; however, there are lessons that will be generalized from this exercise. We will write a paper that presents our broad ideas of spatial interaction, and the datasets we produce that represent built, natural, and human capital will be made available. This paper will encourage and challenge others to find and document tangible ways in which these capitals interact spatially to profoundly influence the value of a broader array of ecosystem services. \nEcosystem services are spatially dependent on:\n• Built capital context (urban areas - and related infrastructure)\n• Natural capital context (land cover and related ecosystem services)\n• Human capital context (e.g. population density and level of economic development)\n• Physical context (e.g. bathymetry, elevation, climate )\nSeveral of the datasets that are either assembled or derived from this work warrant broad dissemination as global data products disaggregated to 1 km2 spatial resolution: \n 1) The economic value of storm protection services provided by coastal ecosystems. \n 2) The number of lives saved per year by coastal ecosystems.\n 3) The built capital of the world modeled using nighttime lights datasets.\n 4) The natural capital of the world modeled using land cover datasets.\n 5) The human capital of the world modeled using population density, nighttime lights, and national economic statistics.', 'Metrics of Success\nSeveral of the datasets that are either assembled or derived from this work warrant broad dissemination as global data products disaggregated to 1 km2 spatial resolution: \n 1) The economic value of storm protection services provided by coastal ecosystems. \n 2) The number of lives saved per year by coastal ecosystems.\n 3) The built capital of the world modeled using nighttime lights datasets.\n 4) The natural capital of the world modeled using land cover datasets.\n 5) The human capital of the world modeled using population density, nighttime lights, and national economic statistics.\nIn addition, a geo-web based tool using a virtual earth such as Google Earth will be developed which will allow the public, scientists, and policy makers to play ‘what if?’ scenarios in which they could draw a storm track on a virtual globe and enter wind speed and category information. They would then be presented with a map of the value of the wetlands in that storm’s swath, their economic value, and an estimate of the number of human lives those coastal ecosystems saved. This research will inform any cost/benefit analyses for coastal projects and could be used by the insurance industry.

These efforts will link to the International Rice Informatics Consortium, using data curated by IRIC while returning analytical results that have been processed. These steps will result in an open platform where the games and educational dialogue will lead to knowledge transfer to the playing populaces in their local languages.  \nThe open source, open manufacturing, group-based social approaches give us new opportunities to conduct relevant research and democratize the scientific process leveraging the technological base of 4G, smartphone, compute clusters, data centers, and web 2 technologies. Yet, taken together they provide the means to actively engage the global technology to solve the critical need of sustainably feeding the world. Questions arise such as:  How do we mine the wealth of rice (and other crop) genomic data? How do we link the structural data to the other information that illuminates its function?  How do we optimize this approach to feed forward for the future of all mankind?\nFine-tuning a simulation of recombination over historical time that coalesces to the most common ancestral state at a particular time in the past is the key research question being answered. This requires a number of discrete steps: The genome will be scanned by segmenting into minimal length segments that result in one event of a genome changing its grouping to that of another genome subgroup. Hence, there is a need for millions of computations for short alignment, possible gap-filling (imputation), tree optimization by clustering (branch-swapping with intervention), assignment to group (minimal path defined), and building the overall picture of the admixture as a heat map with a zoom function (stream compression). Once a region spans a gene model, new tests will be incorporated that atomize the annotation into improved CV and ontology descriptions. Each of these steps would constitute a separate game module (from Ents to Onts with Lines, Coalesces, Mixes, Paths, Streams, and Maps) coded in an open source environment. Players will compete with higher scores awarded to solution(s) for the more complicated regions. The end result will establish a global picture of the history of introgression via natural or imposed selection over historical time in rice, with innate faculty for pattern recognition by eye playing a key role and improving on the machine learning approach. The optimized blocks will serve to improve computational approach by providing new training sets and optmized parameters.\nThis “OryGames” suite will be made public via low-cost Android smartphone platforms like XiaoMi (Singapore, http://www.mi.com/ph/), OnePlus (China, http://oneplus.net/) and MicroMax (India, http://www.micromaxinfo.com/) and a web-API to the database server. The Android platforms also provide a means to integrate crowd funding opportunities alongside democratised, open science on big data. Hence, not only do we create a new infrastructure, but we also train communities in new tools and educate them about food by playing with it. As a proof of concept, this project will create the initial modules of OryGames for the open data analysis of rice genomic data.', 'OryGames will be an open source platform for pattern recognition. It will be served from an API interacting with a cloud-based project server and the curated genome sets of the IRIC database. The games will be java/C based, platform independent and tailored to smart phones and browsers through web services. Each of the tasks to find the patterns of recombinations encompassed by 10,000 years of rice domestication and selection defines a gaming level of the “OryGames – go play with your food’ ecosystem: Ents, Lines, Coalesces, Mixes, Paths, Streams, Maps and Onts. The algorithmic procedure encapsulates computational steps into blocks that can be treated in parallel:\n1) Pre-process partitioning the rice genome into overlapping fragments of lengths up to that of the more coarsely defined LD blocks that are minimally informative (server-side) \n2) Identify problem regions for gaming and imputation (OryEnts)\n3) Manually refine alignment through folding and other geometric operations (OryLines)\n4) Compute trees and improve local order by assisted branch-swapping optimization using the coalescent (OryCoalesces)\n5) Perform canonical grouping for k = 2 to n having the best AIC fit, get groups and check their fit against adjacent trees looking for position that ‘breaks’ the pattern (a group swap occurred) (OryMixes), \n6) Define broader groups by aggregation to lay the optimal path to the most common ancestor (OryPaths)\n7) Compress paths across neighboring regions and in historical time (OryStreams)\n8) Visualize and build heat maps by convergence and setting color bit maps (OryMaps)\n9) Curate underlying annotation through atomization of data after decoding of encryption via rdf/nano- citation of CVs, ontologies and associated supporting information (OryOnts)\nGitHub management and crowd/cloud jam online hackathons will be used via AWS or another cloud service provider. The IRIC portal will serve data, and the gaming interface portal will link to back the IRIC portal. The API framework will use semantic technologies and a hybrid model (realtional and NoSQL) to track, accumulate and feedback results. \nThrough societal affiliations such as ISCB, programmers in rice growing countries (Philippines, Indonesia, China, India, Nigeria, and Brazil) will be actively recruited to build teams for coding tasks. The global programming community of the South will participate in open development under controlled management with an open platform and a hackerspace of knowledge built and applied. This programming model of shared tasks and crowd refinement fits into the development goals for infrastructure, and democratization of open data through crowd-based annotation and analysis contributes to the OSCDnet goals. \nSince visual acuity plays a key role, the hardware model solutions such as the GPU and now TrueNorth (Merolla et al 2014) clusters provide models for handling meshed communication between gaming cells for processing. A heuristic test will be constructed to test whether the human curation improves a region by examining the fit of ‘gamed blocks’ to those with unambiguous machine-curation that are adjacent. The end result will be shifting patterns between and among groups of rice at the finest-scale that encompasses a change in the information criterion determined by the heuristics of play. The definition of some level (k) for partitioning will set the groups for pan-genome construction by reconciliation to the most-common shared ancestral state. Overlaying shifting parameters and use of refined blocks as training sets may improve the machine learning algorithms by constraining the phase space search. Gamers will be educated in genetics and the impact arising from their competitive play for our understanding of rice and how we can improve it; they will also be encouraged to crowd fund this and efforts to bridge the rice genotype to phenotype. Since this project constitutes a proof of concept, focus will be given on inital modules, extending to others once they have been coded.\nIRRI has succeeded in hosting local developers in “Bigas” (rice) hackathons that have contributed to Nutrient management and other smart-phone apps. This approach will be extended to a cloud jam using GitHub as the management tool. A software developer for the data services and web interface (and connections to the IRIC database) will be hired to coordinate this with the global team. Additionally, Drs. Good and Wadstipühl both have considerable experience in creating genetic games to extract bioinformatic knowledge . Other partners come from IRIC. TGAC participated in “Fraxinus”, the ash die-back disease diversity game on facebook that improved alignments among reads for genome builds (MacLean 2013). TGAC will provide a linkage to the Fraxinus’ Sainsbury team. AGI, GigaScience, and the Plant and Crop ontology communities also bring expertise in big data and open semantic science.', 'The project will generate and democratize access to big data and novel computation for rice research and innovation driven by the billions of netizens in the South with access to mobile and web-based technologies. The project will provide curated data improving our understanding of rice genomic diversity, the key cereal providing nutrition for most of the Global South countries. This approach will raise community awareness about their food’s history while giving the gaming community intriguing puzzles to solve through applied visual and mental acuity skills. The puzzle will also illustrate the process of selection with or without intent (natural or imposed) and how this information is critical to understand genetics, improve breeding and ensure that humanities need for sustained food production is met. By defining of the timing and location of recombinations in rice and mapping the results, a clearer picture will emerge of how mankind has shaped a  species turned into key crop. Through processing encapsulated steps, a network of shifting patterns over time and space will be drawn – and embodies a novel human-assisted machine learning approach that could teach algorithms how to perform better. The educational side of the game will be adapted to local culture and language and for use in primary and secondary biology courses.\nThe development of the gaming platform and its API interaction to external data stores through semantic technology will be open source, available, adaptable and extendable to other data sets and purposes as long as proper acknowledgement and attributions are made. The cloud crowd jam, hack and fund data approach will be tested and applied, further strengthening the role society can play in determining its future by sustaining and increasing knowledge of our food supply.', 'Results will be delivered to the IRIC database for broad dissemination and use, tracking their use and contribution will be a one evaluation criterion. Novel improved tools will result from this effort, tracking their hits and modifications will serve as another mechanism for project monitoring and evaluation. Two key outputs will be a) the visualization of maps and paths between blocks and their associations to defined traits and locations and b) the curation of new traits and data to CVs and ontologies by atomized descriptions of genes, alleles, and associated information in a semantic framework contributed to the community, a wiki-games if you like. Other results will be improved models and computational networks trained to detect recombination (and potentially other signals) from noisy backgrounds. Levels of play by the community and click through to crowd funding sites will provide further measures to monitor and evaluate success. All of this information will need tracking, and project management tools for development under the CG framework for impact will be applied.', 'CAN $80,000', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/IRRI-OCSDApplication-LettersofSupportSep2014(signed).pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/IRRI-Budget-OCSD-Sep20141.xlsx', 90, NULL, 'complete', 'yes', 1410163988, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, 'yes');

(37, 'Principal Researcher (PR) has been actively involved in NGO sector since 2000. He has a sound inside knowledge of the value context and research cultures of the NGO sector in India. He has worked consistently with NGO sector actors on promoting collaborative research with community members/citizens participating actively and equitably in the research processes. His experience in and knowledge of community-driven research programmes and deployment of collaborative research tools such as embodied research, collaborative/collective enquiry, community researcher training methods and activist research (much more than action research), have helped him to promote the idea and practice of decentering experts and centering community members in the social science research endeavours. He has extensive knowledge and expertise in leveraging social media resources and technologies for facilitating collaborative research and crowdsourced knowledge generation and management. He has been serving as consultant trainer for NGOs on social media and internet planning for participatory and collaborative research and knowledge planning and management. He has built adequate skills in application of digital technologies and softwares for web designing, document generation, data mining, web crawling, audio and video editing, videography, desktop publishing, crowd sourcing etc. His expertise in qualitative data analysis tools and softwares such as AtlasTi and NVivo will come handy for harvesting learnings from the collaborative and open research prosed to be promoted by this proposal. \n\nHe has undertaken research projects on the most neglected communities such as beggars, sex workers, homeless, third gender, HIV-infected and untouchables. In all these research projects, a collaborative research model was applied with the members from the respective community serving as researchers, trainers and analysts. The process of making them as owners of this knowledge is waiting to be undertaken by translating the research output into vernacular languages and by creating softwares and technologies that will enable them to store, retrieve and use the knowledge. \n\nPR has been part of the global level efforts taken by conscientious scholars who have been lobbying for alternative social knowledge-making framework and practices. This is born out of our discomfiture with exclusivist expert-centred social science powers that valourise the divide between knowledge-makers and knowledge-users. In this connection, the PR has been working towards creating a context and conditions for non-institutional knowers (as against scholars) to participate in knowledge making practices on the one hand; and in privileging alternative modes of knowledge articulation (such as oral, pictorial and performative expressive forms).\n\nIn addition to these, the PR (as he was located in the formal Institutional structure -Gandhigram University recently) has created a weblog for students to become active partners in pedagogic processes. Students can access and create educational contents in this blog. They will also participate in the content creation process with their own handwritten magazines. \n\nSo far collaborative content creation has been undertaken with village women and transgender by training them as experts in videography. This has helped us to shoot videos of themselves and analyse them in their company for interpretation.\n\nHe is a seasoned capacity building consultant for many NGOs in India.', 'Communities Inside The Logic Of Discovery: Opening Social Science Research Processes To Collaborative Interventions', 'India', 'The social and institutional context at which social science knowledge is produced has been undergoing tremendous transformation globally. Formal academic institutions are being increasingly competed with and challenged by non-institutional actors. Particularly with reference to social (science) knowledge, dealing with development challenges such as food security, health-shock faced by the poorest, ecological degradation etc, the shift in contexts has been more striking. Such knowledge is increasingly generated, processed and owned at spheres not normally associated with formal knowledge production centres, like universities and government-funded research centres. India is no exception to this and even demonstrates more unique sites of tendencies of social science knowledge production and disseminations viz., Little Magazines and NGOs sectors to name a few. The former is more theoretical its engagement, whereas the latter is more application oriented. The actors who are involved in social science knowledge-making in these sites are also quite unconventional in that they are not always formally trained institutional intellectuals. Their significance lies in their transgressive potentials and counter-epistemological strategies and practices These offer refreshing critiques and intriguing lessons for the way mainstream social sciences emanating from the knowledge power centres and reproduced slavishly by their captive minds outside of these power centres. \nBesides their intense potential to critique, they offer enormous scope for setting up an open access to participation by citizen knowers in research process that generate development knowledge for pressing social issues such as a health and food security. Although NGO sectors in India, as elsewhere, still ape knowledge-making practices entrenched in intellectual power centres of the west, there still exists a marginal, but very vibrant, anti-establishment research practices and tradition within NGO sector in India and other places. They demonstrate more openness to alternative research methodologies and tools. They are also more amenable to persuasions for engaging communities and non-expert social actors (ordinary people) as partners in research programmes at every stage. There are fragmented and discrete efforts within the NGO sector to engage non-experts to own the entire research process, from designing to disseminating the research output. However in the absence of a dedicated infrastructure to collate and converge these efforts, such fragmented efforts appear less appealing and least influential for others to follow, let alone to reverse knowledge production processes in formal academic portals. Crucially, unlike the existing open science and open source networks, in which the self-consciously pro-open expert knowers (we avoid using the term ‘experts’ as it excludes a vast array of people who may know more about the issue inquisitions than the experts) ambitiously aspire to store and share knowledges generated through mostly conventional research processes, there is a pressing need to privilege, document, train, inspire and eventually normalise the community-owned research processes and outcomes. \nOpen/Citizen/people’s science initiatives globally, and more specifically in India, despite their noble intentions, have treated people/citizens more as recipients of scientific knowledge or as objects of reform, they have tended to exclude them from process of knowledge making itself. In a Karl Popper’s fashion, opening science to public mostly effected by people/citizens as partners in the demonstrated use of such knowledge but not in production of such knowledge. There is a pressing need to making people/public participants in the logic of discovery of social knowledge rather than merely in the logic of demonstration of scientific knowledge. This proposal will make a case for building infrastructure and technologies for generating a gamut of resources, avenues (real/virtual) and institutional context/conditions for open and collaborative research practices involving public in the Logic of Discovery sites and practices. \nProject Objectives:\nSetting up digital and IT-enabled infrastructure for the purpose elaborated above. \nIdentifying and documenting best practices on community-owned collaborative research endeavours already underway in NGO sectors \nDocumenting challenges and difficulties faced in such collaborative research practices. \nStudying the scope for challenging established scientific paradigm and identifying alternative ways of conducting scientific inquiry. \nExploring and creating opportunities for mainstreaming open and participated research inquiry in academic establishments. \nEvolving research protocols and metrics for expanding space for and privileging community-first, open and collaborative research practices in conventional research establishments. \nSetting up a virtual journal that promotes community-first and collaborative research publication mentored by pro-open knowers. \nInstalling e-wall for communities to visibilise people’s/community’s research concerns and research designs, resource availability and expertise for entrenched academic institutions to use and address. \nLearning via internet ethnography from pro-open and alternative social science networks operating globally and avoid re-inventing the wheel. \nThis will hope to forge a mutually-enabling and -correcting alliance between expert and non-expert actors/knowers.', 'This project is pro-open and equitably collaborative in essence. Thus it adopts an interpretative research design with multimodal research methodologies and tools. Simultaneously it is driven by the deep commitment to restructure the research relationship conventionally solidified in favour of the researcher/project holder. \nWhile the PR of this project has been trying to address these concerns for a long period of time as he has engaged with many pro-people research projects, he has not missed an opportunity to evolve the concern expressed in this research proposal with community members. Many activists and NGO heads, without formal degrees or training in academic institutions, have expressed the concerns elaborated above. Indeed the very founder of the NGO I am affiliated with is a school walkout and a campaigner for pro-people organic farming has been vocal in mainstreaming this concern.\nThis project will adopt qualitative, virtual ethnography, social media mining, semiotics and action/activist research methods and tools. The data generated thus will be analysed and processed to build an alternative theory of science and development.\nThis project has two communities as its primary collaborators/co-researchers: 1) NGO sector actors that include experts and their non-expert subject population; and 2) knowers in communities who will incorporate themselves into the development research processes, initially as collaborators and eventually as co-owners of the research processes and output to build a community-mediated open systems of social science knowledge-production and dissemination. \nWhen engaging with NGO actors, this project will initially adopt web crawling method to identify best practices on open modes of research processes and open epistemologies adopted within NGO sectors. Simultaneously it will create a digital domain to function as umbrella domain for inviting and engaging with NGOs involved and interested in open social science research processes in which communities actively participate. Once identified, it will adopt a digital ethnography method to learn about the processes, challenges and outcomes. The digital space in the form of social media or web domain will eventually serve as the hub for storage of community knowledge and capacity building for organisations and individuals interested in community-owned research and knowledge base. \nWhen working with communities it will engage in development of digital tools and softwares for facilitating intense community engagement in social science/scientific/development research on food sovereignty and health issues. \nWith the arrival of affordable technologies (such as mobile phone with camera, availability of internet) and easy engagement with social media the possibility of people participating in public (though IT-enabled virtual) sphere has tremendously expanded. Now people with little or no literacy can easily capture life events and articulate their concerns and aspirations via social media applications or other dedicated applications in their mobile phones. Hence this project will strive to develop applications (android apps) for communities to engage with knowledge-making processes that are open to community engagement. These apps will be adequately tempered with ethical sensitivity relating to privacy and unfair data extraction. \n\nResearch Tools\nDigital ethnography: working with NGO sector organisations, their staff and partners for learning the outcomes of their community -owned development research initiatives.\nParticipatory Observations with communities engaged in collaborative research. \nCase studies collection via Storying: Humans (and even organisations) live storied lives. Life is a series of story telling moments within the largest story called life itself. Humans communicate intensely and authentically, through stories. When allowed to tell stories, people are at their articulating best, though there may be untruths and overdramatizations.\n\nNet chatting on Conversational mode: Conversation can be conducted best if there is an occasion for interplay of stories between  parties in conversation, so storying too requires mutual disclosure. Thus when collecting experiences and aspirations of people and organisations participating in research processes one can facilitate them to emerge in the form of stories.\n\nKeyword and image analysis: By crawling websites and social media domains, not only evidences for community-owned or community ownable  research projects will be identified but their potential for offering critiques of the dominant science paradigm will be captured. \n\nThis research design and methodological tools will have a bearing on the open science networks including OSCD net, in terms of opening research processes to community ownership and scrutiny. When Citizen scientists/knowers who are absent or at the margins of the knowledge making process find themselves at the centre of knowledge production processes, they can offer many corrections to the way science conducts itself even in a pro-open manner. OSCD can move citizen knowers from playing the role of critics of the knowledge (produced away from and minus them) to one of central makers of that knowledge.', 'Theoretical Challenge: The main outcome of this will be setting up of a broad alliance of organisations and individuals who believe in alternative social science and development knowledge. This knowledge evolves in an open fashion with communities and non-expert knowers participating in it throughout the research process. This type of grounds-up research will have the potential to challenge the paradigm governing the social science research itself even as it will bring in native categories and ethos into the social science knowledge. \n\nMethodological Plurality: Secondly the arrival of people and communities at the centre stage of research processes with their own set of world-views, competencies and expressive traditions, will alter the social scene practice itself. Social science with their strong euro-american biases will have to innovate and even reinvent themselves in the form of new methodologies and research cultures so as to make them relevant for other societies and cultures. This should breed a new universal social science. Similarly development studies too need to temper themselves  with local realities and concerns. The development vision too will be challenged. \n\nWe have studied the impact of social knowledge produced by non-institutional intellectuals in Tamil Nadu, India. If we could expand the scope of participation by others, then the impact can be tremendous for those craving for an alternative social science or for an alternative development practice. \n\nCreation of Knowledge- Base and Research Protocols: Substantially, this project will offer a broader knowledge base contributed by non-experts as primary producers of social knowledge. This knowledge base could be available for learning, reflections, training, capacity building and formation of theories and newer research agendas. Such openly and collaboratively built social knowledges can be privileged over privatised closed systems knowledge by creating new metrics and ranking systems for rewarding and incentivising alternative social science knowledges. This will generate new research protocols for collaborative research for even academic institutions to follow. \n\nOnline community of alternative social science researchers: There is a vibrant force of social knowledge makers in many part of the world, who have opted out of conventional knowledge making frameworks and structures, either by choice, or by because of their inability to comprehend the intricacies of and succeed in this clearly one-sided euro-american intellectual power centres. These knowers immersed as they in their local ethos and concerns will find the online space created by this project an enabling sanctuary to produce grounded knowledge, mediate community-owned knowledge-making practices and even critique conventional knowledge. They may also serve as mentors for organisations, academic institutions and individuals, converting into pro-open social sciences. \n\nDevelopment Solutions: Keeping Food security and Health Equity as the focal points, this project, to begin with, will work towards forming an alliance of NGOs and activists and citizen scientists in generating collaborative knowledges and development solutions for ensuring, among other issues, food sovereignty and health equity.\n\nDigital tools, softwares and online learning resources for alternative and community-owned knowledge making and dissemination initiatives and creation of knowledge base for development policy influencing local and global governance systems.', 'Being an online community the activities of this project can be seen and observed on real time. Being a crowdsourced knowledge base online monitoring can be done continuously. A credible ever-present feedback and online evaluation channels will be available for anyone coming to this online media to offer their comments. In a self-appraisal mode, this project will report its progress transparently in its online domain for inviting comments and dispassionate evaluation.\n\nBesides this, the project will develop qualitative and quantitative indicators to measure its progress. These indicators will be collectively generated and an oversight body with community knowers as constituent members will monitor and evaluate the project. Another aspect against which the project can be evaluated periodically and even real time is the number of willing collaborating organizations and communities that have signed up as members. Its expanding membership base can be another indicator.  Its number of visitors to the web sites and social media domains can be another source for continuous motivations. \n\nThough it starts its operations in India, its progress can be measured in terms of it expansion in southern hemisphere nations. Its influence can be measured as it hoped to unite third world NGOs and willing academicians to form a broad based alliance. \n\nAnother indicator is the number of capacity building programmes organized and number of people participated. Simultaneously the number of toolkits and training modules that have been generated in the most collaborative fashion can be a quantitative indicator. These can be monitored both online and offline. In online mode number of organizations and individuals who have received and offered mentoring via this website. In the offline mode, the number of programmes and consultations that have taken place in India and other global locations. \n\nThe accumulations of community based knowledge and concerns are another indicator against which it can be measured. \n\nNumber of research contributions that are put up for use, reuse and critical appreciation is another indicator, as this project hopes to convert many organizations and individuals into open research initiatives. \n\nGeneration of alternative ranking and accreditation metrics and reward protocols and the successful embracing of the same of many agencies, institutions and organizations can be a credible indicator for monitoring and evaluations. \n\nNumber of successful cross-border alliances and networking with similar organizations can be both a good qualitative and quantitative indicator.\n\nIts larger success in evolution and application of development solutions accomplished via this project can be taken as an impact indicator. \n\nThese indicators will form the basis for midterm and regular M&E processes. In all these broader stakeholder involvement will be facilitated. Innovative methodologies, such as Most-Significance Change, Appreciative Inquiry and Outcome harvesting etc will be used for effective monitoring of the project. \n\nIts most salient impact indicator will be its successful formulation of a theory of change and institutionalization of alternative research cultures within social science and development studies. This will be evaluated in terms of how many organizations and academic institutions have adopted the theory of change and internalized the knowledge-making practices.', 'CAD 73480', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/Endorsement1.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudgetTemplate_3.xlsx', 63, 251, 'complete', 'yes', 1411161666, 'complete', '', '', 38, NULL, 'yes'),

This sector employs 80% of the total active population, supplies 90% of the country food needs, is the source of 63% of foreign exchange earnings and contributes to the Gross Domestic Product only at 31% (MINAGRI, 2011). There is a need for more performance in Rwandan agriculture in terms of volume of production and productivity. \n\nRwandan agriculture is in transition from subsistence farming to market-oriented agriculture, as the policy considers that a dynamic agriculture, fully integrated in the national economy, gender-sensitive and conducted in an environmentally-friendly way can stimulate positive changes in the other sectors of the economy and the country life. The agricultural development in Rwanda has many challenges (high population density, production dominated by primary sector and less performance in marketing and transformation, hilly landscape with diverse agroecologies, high erosion, poor research and extension services), but it is struggling for overcoming them.\n\nCereals cover 50% of the arable land worldwide (Abecassis et al., 2014). Maize, wheat and rice accounted together for 89% of the total world cereal production and 43% of the total food calories (FAO, 2012). Cereals are among the priority crops in Rwanda. Maize, rice and wheat are among the major crops wherever they can be grown in Rwanda and they are the pillars of the Crop Intensification Programme (CIP), a Rwandan version of the green revolution. The local consumption of sorghum is also important. A study has shown that the average yield for wheat in Rwanda in the 1980s was 0.7t/ha, far inferior to 5.9 t/ha realised in Zimbabwe and the average of 1.5t/ha in tropical Africa on the same period (Tanner and Raemaekers, 2001) .  \n\nThe scientific base for fully taking advantage of the cereal varieties used in Rwanda, or even for breeding for more performing varieties is low. The Web of Science database generates only 3 articles when the words Rwanda and cereals are introduced as topics (consulted on July 7, 2014). Critical mass of information is needed especially because Rwanda has very diverse agroecologies.  \n\nOne of the aspects on which very limited information is available on cereals in Rwanda is about their protection against pests and diseases. Fusarium is a genus with many species pathogenic to cereals. Diseases caused by Fusarium species are increasing worldwide (Savary et al., 2012) and losses caused by Fusarium on wheat can be as high as 80% (McMullen et al., 2012). \n\nWhen studying Fusarium diseases, other factors should be taken into account: most Fusarium species can produce toxins, which are toxic to human and animals, thus reducing the value of the produce for consumption and marketing; for controlling Fusarium diseases, people use large quantities of pesticides, as they have less alternatives like a functional IPM (Integrated pest management) package, which might leave residues on the produce and also pollute the environment; no published information is available on the species of Fusarium that are present in Rwanda, and the susceptibility of the available varieties to Fusarium diseases and the level of contamination of the seeds as most Fusarium diseases are seed-transmitted (Wulff et al., 2010), through horizontal gene transfer (Ma et al., 2013).  \n\nStudies have shown that though the scientific information on which the improved crop protection practices in Rwanda can be based is low, there is even a need to improve the flow of available agricultural information from the primary source to the end user, the farmer (Baributsa et al., 2013). \n\nThe aim of this impact-minded and integrated research programme is:\n• Exploring the available information on Fusarium diseases on cereals in Rwanda and elsewhere;  \n• Taking varied samples of symptoms of Fusarium diseases on cereals and identifying the causal organisms;\n• Research on the interaction of Fusarium and host plants at the molecular level;   \n• Developping an action plan: field intervention guided by the findings from research so that the control of Fusarium in cereals can be conducted in an IPM manner; \n• Offering opportunity to young people for getting a professional internship in agricultural sciences, biological engineering and rural development;    \n• Working for sustainability and impact by involving all the major actors concerned by cereal production and development in Rwanda (researchers, farmers, interns, policy and decision makers, etc.); \n• Organising a farmer field school (FFS) for the whole production season of the cereals of interest; \nCollecting all the needed information and paving the way for breeding cereals for resistance against Fusarium diseases in Rwanda.', 'Methodology: The research component\n\nFor developing the research methodology on Fusarium diseases on cereals in Rwanda, the following factors will be taken into account: \n• There is quality research (published and available in scientific database) that has been done in other parts of the world that can be adapted to Rwanda; \n• There is research information on Rwanda that has been generated but not scientifically published; \n• The agroecological zones of Rwanda can be divided in 3 subgroups: high altitudes (volcanic zone, Buberuka Highlands,etc.), middle altitudes (Central Plateau) and low altitudes (Bugarama, Umutara, etc.). \n• There are places dominated by local consumption (rural areas), those that are near urban areas and those that are near the capital, Kigali. \n• Wheat is grown in high altitudes, maize is grown in all the altitudes and rice is grown in middle altitudes and low altitudes; \n• Studying the disease in seeds, on field in production and in post harvest. \n\nSamples of diseased plants will be as varied as possible, so as to take into account all these factors. \n\nSamples of Fusarium attacks will be taken and submitted to further analysis. The analysis will involve the isolation and the purification of the fungal organisms associated with the symptoms. Isolation and purification will be conducted on culture media. The fungal mycelium will be harvested, lysed and its DNA extracted. The identification of the organisms will be done by sequencing, first based on the ITS region (White et al., 1990) and if it is a Fusarium organism, further sequencing based on elongation factor (O''Donnell et al., 1998). Pathogenicity studies will be conducted to test the pathogenicity of identified isolates and the molecular interactions between the pathogen and the host will be guided by the virulence and/or the production of toxins.   \n\nMethodology: the implementation component with internships and FFS approach \n\nThe research will start by desk research and by linking found information to the real field information. Desk research will be followed by surveys for defining the importance of Fusarium diseases. The first tentative representation of the problem in the country will be drafted. Another one will be made after the purification of isolates from Rwanda and their identification by sequencing. \n\nWhen a solid scientific base is available on Fusarium diseases on cereals in Rwanda, a manual and an intervention plan will be developed and implemented through a Farmer Field School (FFS) methodology. Interns will be helped to acquire the know-how that they will use in the laboratory work and in assisting farmers in implementing the new integrated Fusarium management practices.', 'Expected Development?related Outcomes and Relevance: reinforcement of the aspects of research for development by addressing the root cause of poverty in the Rwandan context. \n\nTo make sure this research is oriented to development, the following elements will be central in its planning and implementation: \n- The majority of poor farmers are women who take care of their families; \nThe legal texts attributes one third (1/3) of decision making posts to women and each activity done in the country must be gender sensitive. In line with this policy, one third of the informants and one third of the collaborators/beneficiaries of Farmer Field Schools will be composed of women. Skills that women acquire are easily transmitted to children and shared with the whole community. \n- This research will help farmers take advantage of the agricultural policy in Rwanda; \nIn Rwanda, the land policy attributes its ownership to legal owner and as r-there are not many big farms, most farmers have their own plot of land. In the last years, the government has been helping farmers in accessing farm inputs like seeds and fertilizers. By putting improved knowledge at their disposal, farmers have more chances of conducting a productive agriculture \n- To achieve its full potential, the agricultural policy needs a strong and dynamic scientific base; \nAt the base of the progress, there are changes in science and technology that are implemented and change the fife of the humanity. In close cooperation with practionners of agriculture and researchers, we want to contribute in generating quality scientific information that will serve as the base for accelerating progress in agriculture id est for increasing the yield by overcoming Fusarium diseases in an environmentally-friendly way.  \n- The market-oriented agriculture policy goes with professionalization and specialization;\nBy reducing losses caused by Fusarium, farmers can make better yields, for feeding their families but also for supplying the market. Improved and very profitable farming practices are knowledge intensive as they go with professionalization and specialization.   \n- Farmers are helped to become resilient to any new change in the coming years, and much expected as we are in the era of climate change. \nBy organizing a FFS, this project aims at building capacity in farmers, so that they can be able to find immediate answers, but also develop the aptitude of becoming resourceful in the coming years. This is important as not all what will happen in the coming years is predictable, especially in agriculture, where many forces are driving change, including nowadays the climate change. \n- This research will contribute in rising a new generation of researchers for development.\nFrom desktop research, laboratory work to field interventions, this research is conducted by the principal investigator, the partners, the project team and much importantly by the interns. These young people, helped to learn, will perpetuate the practices and improve them and maintain a strong link with the farmers. It will also increase the chances for them to find jobs and design new development initiatives.', 'Which will be the main outcomes: \nActivity  Evaluation indicator\n- Desktop research followed by a report: 2 months;  - A report of desktop research on Fusarium diseases in Rwanda and elsewhere is made\n- Survey by questionnaire followed by a report of major findings: 2 months - A questionnaire is produced ( 2 weeks);\n- A questionnaire is administered to chosen farmers (1 month);\n- Answers from the survey are analysed (2 weeks)\n- Field collection of Fusarium-diseased plant samples: 1 month;  - List of origin and features of collected samples is made\n- Laboratory work: isolation of pathogens: 2 months;  - Reagents, products and technical arrangements are made for isolation in the laboratory (2 weeks)\n- Intensive isolation and purification work in the laboratory (1 month)\n- A report on the isolation work (2 weeks) is made\n- Visit to an advanced laboratory for molecular identification based on preliminary information + report : 4 months (Scientific publication preparation and submission );  - Negotiations with the receiving laboratory are undertaken and closed by the reception of an invitation letter; \n- A list of identified samples is produced; \n- A report of the stay in the laboratory is produced.\n- Writing the technical manual of IPM for Fusarium diseases management in cereals (Provisional ): 1 month;  - A provisional manual on IPM for the management of Fusarium diseases is produced\n- Survey evaluating the situation before starting the Farmer Field Scholl (FFS): 1 month;   - A questionnaire is produced and administered to the farmers; \n- A report on the found information is produced. \n- Organising a Farmer Field School (FFS) based on the Fusarium IPM manual: 6 months;  - The organization of an FFS is discussed with the concerned beneficiaries; \n- A plan for the FFS is produced. \n- Samples taking at some development stages: sowing, flowering, harvesting, post harvest, on the market: 6 months in the same time as FFS running;  - Samples are taken at the critical plant development stages. \n- Survey evaluating the situation after the FFS: 1 month;  - A questionnaire is produced and administered to the farmers; \n- A report on the found information is produced.\n- Report at the end of the FFS evaluating the situation before and the situation after the FFS: 1 months;  - A report ending the FFS is produced. \n- Production of a Fusarium IPM manual ( Definitive): 1 month;  - A Fusarium management manual is produced\n- Meeting the major actors individually for presenting the research findings: farmers, researchers, decision and policy makers, NGO’s, students, etc.: 1 month;  - Meetings are organised and each of them succinctly reported \n- Organising a plenary session for presenting the research findings and deciding about the way forward at the end of the intervention: 1 month.   - All the lessons from the project are discussed in an organised plenary session and the way forward is suggested.', '79800', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/Letter_of_endorsment-BIGIRIMANA_VP3.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudgetTemplate-Filled-BIGIRIMANA_VP.xls', 57, NULL, 'complete', 'yes', 1410165208, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, 'yes');

At every level of decision making, the Constitution requires the public to be consulted and involved. This constitutional requirement seems to have permeated all public institutions. For instance, according to The Universities Act, 2012 section 3(1), among the objectives of a university include; promotion of cultural and social life in society; support and contribute towards to the realization of economic and social development and dissemination of the outcomes of the research conducted by university to the general community. While the Science, Technology and Innovation Act 2013  which stablishes the National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation mandates the Commission to develop, in consultation with stakeholders, the priorities in scientific, technological and innovation activities in Kenya in relation to the economic and social policies of the Government, and the country''s international commitments; ensure co-ordination and co-operation between the various agencies involved in science, technology and innovation; promote and encourage private sector involvement in scientific research and innovation and development. In addition, Article 11(2) (b) and (c) of the Constitution recognizes the role of science and indigenous technologies in the development of the nation, and the promotion of the intellectual property rights of the people of Kenya. \n \nAt service delivery and accountability levels in 2011, Kenya launched an open data portal to make available to the public important government documents for free dissemination. In announcing this initiative President Mwai Kibaki stated: ‘I call upon Kenyans to make use of this Government Data Portal to enhance accountability and improve governance in our country. Indeed, data is the foundation of improving governance and accountability. This is because reliable and timely data is the basis for determining whether the Government is delivering services effectively and accountably. Availability of data will, therefore, enable citizens to keep track of service delivery. This way the people can hold Government service providers accountable for the use of public resources.’ \nThe project, “Assessing the Effectiveness of Open Collaborative Science Initiatives by Kenyan Institutions of High Learning with Grassroots Communities”, investigates how successful institution of higher learning have been in its engagement with the grassroots communities. The study is particularly crucial in relation to the socio-economic context in Kenya, given the focus of the Vision 2030 on social pillar, investing in the people in order to improve quality of life . The Vision emphasis the link between education and the market and the need to strengthen partnerships. These developments are immensely important in political, economic and social domains in Kenya and the Open and Collaborative Science (OCS) has the potential to play an important role in making available crucial scientific information to the public. \n\nSpecifically focusing on Kenya’s universities and their linkage with grassroots, this project aims to identify motivations behind uptake of open collaborative research by researchers, particularly in relation to the grassroots access to scientific discoveries regarding critical social problems and the new development knowledge. Using case study methods in selected university departments where graduate students and faculty conduct studies using open science procedures, this project will identify elements of OCS that have been successful, investigate factors that promote the initiative and also identify areas in which the universities needs to invest to improve OCS for the public good. \nAs the Kenyan Constitution and The University Act allow for more civic involvement in governance, and as such the OCS holds the potential for increased engagement between Universities and the grassroots. This research project seeks to understand how this relationship has evolved and or can be instigated particularly with the focus to solving grassroots problems through collaborative researches and will also address potential areas of improvement. \nJesuit Hakimani Centre is interested in investigating the models of OCS, particularly focusing on how they are helping researchers develop grassroots oriented solutions. \nJHC anticipates that this research will provide an important insight into the workings of universities research departments and their motivations to embrace OCS, and how if at all universities have OCS models are helping communities access new development knowledge and how that better empowers them to participate in their development. This study will also provide universities and policy makers with an understanding of future directions in research sector that will need to be taken and what outcomes communities would like to see out of the OCS.', 'This study aims to explore ways in which Higher Learning Institutions can collaborate with CBOs and NGOs in initiating OCS at the grassroots. Common practice in many institutions of higher learning has been building knowledge silos or knowledge banking without translating it into actionable plans. In many universities shelves and depositories, student continue file in their researches with no hope of having it used by the actors in practice.  As aptly put by Paolo Freire, “If we don’t transcend the idea of education as pure transference of a knowledge that merely describes reality, we will prevent critical consciousness from emerging and thus reinforce political illiteracy.” (Freire, 1985:104). The critical consciousness needed by the researching community is how to make there outcomes actionable. As such, there is need for pedagogical re-orientation to transform how researchers view their enterprise. To commit to new approaches to science and development. Does this position invite new research orientation?  Our objective is to understand how universities are using OCS, identify ways in which they would like it to improve, particularly in relation to contribution towards to the realization of economic and social development of grassroots and dissemination mechanisms of the outcomes of the research, and to create recommendations that address these concerns. The central research question for this study is how OCS frameworks (collaborations between universities, community based organizations, civil society groups and local communities) in the institutions of higher learning could improve universities contribution towards to the realization of economic and social development of counties and dissemination mechanisms of the outcomes of the research conducted by university to the local community. In other words, what success stories exist in both university and communities on the usage of OCS frameworks? What OCS models have emerged? What influences the uptake of OCS? What trends are emerging in the OCS initiative? How will this influence the policy directions of OCS in other sectors?  \n\nMethods plan\nThis project is a case study of OCS initiatives of at the School of Journalism, University of Nairobi and will use both qualitative and quantitative research methods. The project will use a combination of research methods including structured interviews with key informants, focus group discussion, testimonies, questionnaires and document analysis to best understand how universities understand OCS. The questionnaires will be limited to a small number of questions predominantly focusing on awareness of OCS. \n\nStudy area\nThe study concentrates on the School of Journalism, University of Nairobi, Kisii University and Multimedia University graduate programs, its processes and structures. The main research question is informed by the theoretical conception of OCS as a distinct research discipline. This study aims to explore ways in which Higher Learning Institutions can collaborate with CBOs and NGOs in initiating OCS at the grassroots. \n \nSpecific research questions\na) How do university research processes engage with grassroots?\nb) Do university research departments address relevant needs of the community sampled? If so, in what way?\nc) The extent to which the normative principles of OCS are embraced and affirmed by research departments?\nd) Can grassroots community access research departments in any way and do they make use of it?\ne) What are the participatory strategies used by universities in developing and promoting OCS?\n \nSample and sampling procedures\nThe questionnaires will be administered to respondents who will be selected by purposeful stratified random sampling. The study involves the analysis of secondary data: books, journals, organisation documents, and research projects, and primary data and in depth interviews. \n\nProject Activities\n\n1) Complete background research into contexts and conditions under which OCS approaches are likely to be adopted by universities\n2) Analyze frameworks and policies that are likely to enable the practice of OCS\n3) Conduct interviews, focus groups and surveys analyzing levels awareness of OCS approaches\n4) Publish research findings\n5) Host public forums to discuss and distill the research findings\n6) Develop and publish key recommendations for improvement of OCS uptake\n7) Publish position paper on state of OCS in institutions of higher learning\n8) Set up model pilot OCS project with SOJ graduates', 'Project outcomes:\n1) Increased university –CSO cooperation in OCS projects: \nCommon practice in many institutions of higher learning has been building knowledge silos or knowledge banking without translating it into actionable plans.

As such, there is need for pedagogical re-orientation to transform how researchers view their enterprise. To commit to new approaches to science and development, this project aims to pilot an OCS project with School of Journalism graduates at University of Nairobi.\n3) Increased knowledge of OCS  by young researchers: \nThe University Act, 2013 requires institutions of higher learning to support and contribute towards to the realization of economic and social development and dissemination of the outcomes of the research conducted by university to the general community. For instance, how does research departments espoused OCS in their mission? How what models of teaching research would actualize the ideals of OCS? Does the university policies explicitly support an infrastructure for OCS to take root? What mechanisms are in place to support graduates bringing their research back to the communities for action? Would this model of research help improve community livelihoods? This model of research requires researchers to invest in new ideological orientation, from that of knowledge banking to action-oriented which its main focus is citizen empowerment and engagement; research that can empower the grassroots with concrete solutions to tackle problems such as food insecurity and climate change and an ideological orientation that demystify research and allow grassroots to openly and actively participate in the process. This project hope to increase know of OCS to younger researchers through the pilot project and open public forum discussion the findings of the study.', 'The project will be assessed and evaluated for impact through key project milestones that is ( Complete background research into contexts and conditions under which OCS approaches are likely to be adopted by universities; Analyze frameworks and policies that are likely to enable the practice of OCS; Conduct interviews, focus groups and surveys analyzing levels awareness of OCS approaches; Publish research findings; Host public forums to discuss and distill the research findings; Develop and publish key recommendations for improvement of OCS uptake; Publish position paper on state of OCS in institutions of higher learning and Set up model pilot OCS project with SOJ graduates)\nprogress reports and outcomes of the proposed activities.

These temporary fixes have created, among local citizens, a sense of distrust, and opposition to collaboration and cooperation with new external programs. In response, a new approach based on public participation has been initiated, tested, and applied in several locations for various conservation and communal mitigation actions.</p><p>We believe that Public Participation coupled with Open Science, Theme 3, has the advantage of encompassing the scale, contexts, heterogeneity, management intensities, and social and economic co-benefits, tradeoffs, and costs affecting local citizens. Public participation has been the core of the Community Based Development program that Nature Conservation Centre (NCC) has initiated for the last 3 years.</p><p>With the help of Municipal Councils in 55 villages across Lebanon, the team at NCC has developed a village &ldquo;Green Map&rdquo; database. It consists of spatially overlapped aerial photographs and valued landscape components (represented by icons and stories selected by people) through a nationwide public participation GIS (PPGIS) process and by using the Open Green Map (OGM) system?s set of international icons.</p><p>With this approach, benefits and limitations of the method for stock taking of baseline information for landscape planning was evaluated and significant sustainable management systems of communal lands and their spatial associations in relation to the mapped landscape components were identified. PPGIS has been proven to be effective in building a database in a data poor context, involving the community in an ethnically diverse nation, and promoting the implementation of related planning outcomes at the level of local municipalities and national ministries.</p><p>Moreover, this methodology has built trust between academic institutions and communities, which has decentralized the process of map making and village perception, information generation and made it more relevant to local communities.</p><p>This methodology contributes to a shift from conventional centralized policy to a more community-based landscape planning strategy, to the decrease in data basing costs, and to empower locals to adopt meaningful conservation practices by their own initiatives. We propose to apply the successful model of PPGIS-&ldquo;Green Maps&rdquo; to work with the public on the perception, scientific validation, and mitigation based on developed technologies for air, water, and solid waste pollution sources. The research questions that we intend to answer are:</p><p>1. In the lack of public knowledge about air, water and solid waste pollution, will Public Participation and Open Science lead to a sustainable community based planning and management of pollution sources?</p><p>2. What is the role of geographic, social, and financial condition of the community on the progress and implementation of public participation in tackling pollution sources in an area highly affected by desertification due to climate change?</p><p>Based on developed green maps by the AUB-NCC, and relying on evidence and concerns that were expressed by local communities, the proposed approach will be tested on two villages. New components of pollution will be overlaid on the spatial maps in phases starting with people&rsquo;s perception and identification of pollution sources, understanding the need of scientific measurements and their involvement in the data collection, validation and interpretation and proposed solutions based on presented &ldquo;best currently available&rdquo; technologies and case studies.</p><p>The outcomes of public education and awareness campaigns aim to lead to local policies, regulations and pollution source mitigation. Pollution regulations and solid waste management has long been a top-down approach directed mainly by governments or public environmental agencies, rare are the initiatives that tackled this issue from a bottom-up approach. With water becoming a limiting factor in the MENA region, an integrated approach is necessary to remedy the impact of drivers such as demographic and climatic changes that limit water and lead to demands and conflicts.</p><p>Moreover, the prevalence of desertification in the past few years leads to dusty and air polluted environments that affect the ecosystem well-being. Local policy making initiatives contribute significantly to the bottom-up dynamics of policy making as they help shape the complex multilevel coordination to address global issues such as climate change, desertification and loss of natural resources.</p><p>The importance of local action in the conservation of natural resources through participatory planning, knowledge management and capacity building is globally recognized and clearly stated as a goal of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets for the 2011-2020 outlined by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CDB, 2010). By adopting an Open Science approach, we hope to emphasize on the role of informed local people in managing their natural resources.</p>', '<p>We will adopt the methodology of PP-&ldquo;Green Map&rdquo; that was tested and optimized for the past 3 years at AUB-NCC. In brief, this methodology development integrates several participatory approaches and focuses on the village recruitment process, trust building through skilled facilitation, formation of village multi-stakeholder committees composed of members from the public and private sector, and on the production of community based maps and remedial solutions while taking into consideration the natural, sustainable and social dimensions of the village. The approach consists of three defined stages:</p><p>First, the identification of 3 villages based on communications and/or perception that were raised during the development of the Green Map phase;</p><p>second, capacity building for participatory evaluation and mapping; and third, online database building, mitigation approaches and local policy and regulations proposals.</p><p>Following, the established procedure, the recruitment process at the second stage is initiated by a request from the municipality representatives to call for the same or a new municipal council. A village committee (composed of 5 to 10 members), which observes gender balance and includes members from the municipality and from the civil society, will be suggested.</p><p>This gives a chance to women to participate in decision making at the public level where their representation is minimal. As per Meffe et al. (2002) , suggestions for membership are proposed to include members from the educational sector (teachers &amp; principals), the private sector (business owners and entrepreneurs), the civic community (scouts and social groups) and individuals interested in the process.</p><p>Following, an initial visit is made to meet with the mayor and municipal board representatives to explain the extension of the project in detail and elaborate on the objectives, steps of implementation, and expected outcomes of the project. Noted to the committee that throughout the project, the committee is consulted and feedback is solicited regarding the clarity and perceived relevance of the project objectives, level of project buy-in in the village, as well as the suitability of project materials (sample pollution collection and measuring devices).</p><p>In addition, inquiries are always made to determine whether participation in the project is aligned or in support of projects existing or planned by the municipality or the village community. Feedback contributed to constant revisions of the methodology to accommodate stated expectations and needs to better engage in the process. In agreement with the mayor, the committee representatives take charge of ensuring a broad participation of stakeholders, and initiating the community at large. Town-hall meetings, local colleges and schools, and mass media communications are also planned.</p><p>The process includes eight months of fieldwork, which involves open science sessions and participatory workshops and sample collections for lab testing, and four months of lab and deskwork at AUB facilities and AUB-NCC for data validation, data analysis, organizing and posting on the Open Green Map System (www.opengreemap.org). The data is collected through several field activities in collaboration with local community members. These activities include informal meetings, discussion of pollution sources, consequences, and possible solutions, site exploration trips and local mapping sessions.</p><p>The materials, tools and equipment that are used during the working sessions are basic and simple and the sample collection and mapping techniques are designed to make the process comfortable and efficient in order to ensure high quality of the generated information. In the following year, the work will consist of implementing adapted technology for pollution mitigation and control and the production of spatial aerial photographs with Green Map Icons (GMI) relevant to Lebanon and translated into Arabic. Challenges and factors hindering the implementation phase will also be discussed in a public participatory approach.</p><p>So far, the combined methodology enabled the recording of demographical information, natural and cultural landmarks, green space per capita, land tenure ratios, and forest cover percentages.</p><p>Additional collected database will be overlaid to existing maps and uploaded by committee member with the help of AUB-NCC staff to the Open Green Map System. This mapping process is fine-tuned following an adaptive learning loop, &ldquo;learning by doing&rdquo;, approach inferring a structured and iterative process based on scientific validation and shared information, which aims at improving the application of effective public participation prototypes.

This understanding of cultural challenges is reemphasized throughout the process by the &ldquo;loop&rdquo; broad-base approach with the community at large and the alignment of the participation with projects existing or planned by the municipality or the village community in order to ensure a local assessment, conservation and mitigation of local environmental assets and threats.</p><p>Open Science: In addition, open science takes a major part of the proposal as both the field, laboratory components and implementation involve capacity building and knowledge and technology transfer to the community.</p><p>The team will make sure that the whole process of data collection, analysis and recording is demystified, simplified and made accessible to all partners. Training by AUB-NCC staff will be available during the whole period of work and presented to the community as needed. In the pollution assessment process, we will try to engage the public in the data monitoring, data analysis as well as the understanding of the consequences on health and the ecosystem. The sustainable development of solution based on adapted technologies to air, water and solid waste problems will be sought along with local stakeholders taking in consideration all geographic, social and financial conditions of the village. Local policies and regulations will be discussed with the municipal council.</p><p>Database: Data related to demographical information, natural and cultural landmarks, green space per capita, land tenure ratios, forest cover percentages, air, water and solid waste pollution assessments, local policies and technology adaptation will constitute the database collected. Organized in maps, data is disseminated to a wide audience by uploading it to the Open Green Map System (www.opengreemap.org).</p><p>Remedial Solutions and Regulations: A collaborative network encompassing several stakeholders (village representatives, academics, government and non-government organizations), will participate in identifying and addressing pollution issues and subsequently in planning and implementing remedial solutions.</p>', '<p>The methodology will be evaluated at various levels starting with the success of the participatory approach of the municipal council, which includes the involvement of the community at large quantified by number of participants and number of meetings, workshops and round table discussion with stakeholders, and the dedication of the team for the work and the amendment of the methodology based on people&rsquo;s feedback.</p><p>The open science approach will be evaluated based on the ability of AUB-NCC to raise awareness (developed materials and field experiments) and relate to the community the science of pollution and their effects on the ecosystem (number of workshops and field visits).</p><p>With the lack of popular knowledge about air and water pollution sources and their consequences, we rely on more than 10 years of research experience in this field to transmit the information to concerned public.</p><p>In fact, the PI is affiliated with a team at AIR UCI at the University of California, Irvine, who conducts popular atmospheric pollution workshops including fun and simplified demonstrations to local schoolteachers. This effort is supervised by Professor Barabara Finlayson-Pitts and the program is part of an NSF (National Science Foundation) grant. In the same line, the PI has initiated collaboration with Dr. Elizabeth Erickson at the University of Southern California to start a new storytelling book series for children that promote chemistry concepts and emphasize on the need of chemistry to solve life mysteries.</p><p>The efforts will also be evaluated by the validity of the monitoring sites, sampling collection, data handling and analysis all of which will be conducted according to international standards and specifications. In involving the public in the initial process, discussion of the results and assessment of the consequences in a public participatory approach will lead to viable solutions and preventions that suit local residents (number of round table discussion).</p><p>Success of this proposed methodology is also assessed based on adopted technology solutions that will be suggested while considering the present ecosystem and implemented with the help of local or other supportive stakeholders. In the case where the results of the field campaign show compliance with international standards, the results will be used to promote good practices in the village.</p><p>The team at AUB-NCC has discussed this approach with the Ministry of Tourism and packages of Community-Based Tourism based on green practices will be prepared and promoted. At the global scale, collected data will take part of the open green map system where it will be uploaded and disseminated. Data on air and water pollution in Lebanon and the region are very scarce. If available, this data is focused on few large and highly populated cities. By undertaking this work, a database of air and water pollution level will be integrated as a part of a complete ecosystem and shared as such with the global community. As a result of that, local, national as well as global remedial solutions become easier to realize.</p>', '80.000 Canadian dollars', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/20150907.Endorsement_letter_1.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/20140907.OCSDNetBudget2.xlsx', 150, 251, 'complete', 'yes', 1411161432, 'complete', '', '', 31, 'yes', 'yes'),
(41, 'Sari Hanafi: editor of the Idafat-The Arab Journal of Sociology (Arabic) and member of editorial board many Arab and International academic journals. Being a faculty member at AUB, he draws many arguments from his own experience and considers this university as a case study. He was also a director of a research center: Center for Palestinian Refugees and Diaspora (Shaml) where he was exposed to policy and public social research. Being a vice president and before that a member of the Executive Committee of the International Sociological Association and the Arab Council of Social Science allows him to be familiarized with issues related to the formation and institutionalization of the scientific community.\nMaha Shuayb: As a researcher, she carried out many studies on sociology of education, education reforms, equity and equality in Education, refugee Education, Social justice and social cohesion, human rights Citizenship education, history education. \nRigas Arvanitis: has developed programs on the dynamic of research, the links between research and production, the rise of scientific communities in the developing world, the international collaborations in science, the study of technological learning and innovation in firms. He has worked in France, Venezuela, Mexico, China and the Arab Mediterranean countries (17 years permanently outside Europe).', 'Citizenship empowerment: Dis(connection) between knowledge producers and users in studies of refugees and education reforms in Lebanon', 'Lebanon', 'Universities in the Arab world have often produced compartmentalized elites inside each nation-state with limited communication with one another. They are either elite that publish globally and perish locally or elite that publish locally and perish globally. These universities have pushed their professors to publish mainly in “international” academic journals. Large publishing companies (Elsevier, Kluwer) have taken strong commercial positions, making the scientific community an instrument of commercial objectives. With the advent of Open Science, strong protests have emerged from working scientists who have used the force of ‘social digital networks’ to mobilize the community giving way to a renewal of peer partnerships. The Arab world could profit intellectually from this movement, but so far promotion systems in many universities have vilified Open Science and underrated them.  \n\nIn the forthcoming Hanafi’s and Arvanitis’s Arab research and knowledge society: the impossible promise, the authors point out the fragmentation between policy making and knowledge production and knowledge translation in the Arab world. Their study of research practice in the Arab world reveals an inflation of policy research studies in the Arab East mainly by INGO at the expense of professional and critical research, to use the typology of Michael Burawoy (2005). They also indicate a lack of reflexive work that relates to the un-critical type of policy-related empirical research. Moreover, they identify a disjunction between knowledge production and its translation to policy-making and to public. While, policy, professional, critical and public research were interrelated and complementary in countries such as France, the Arab world was characterized by a fractured relationship between these different types of research. \n\nThe objective of this proposal is to take two issues within the domain of citizenship empowerment and participation, namely education reform and Palestinian refugee status/situation in Lebanon to investigate the following: \n- The academic publication in both fields in commercial journals/books\n-  Open Science in both fields in the academic publication\n- Open science produced by NGOs, INGOs and Foundation in both fields and whether there are collaborative efforts and initiatives between universities, research centers and (I)NGOs.  Otherwise we would like to investigate research practices weather they are based on networked collaboration: locally, regionally and internationally.\n- How were these two types of publications “translated” into various publics through newspapers, social media, mass media, etc.\n- How foreign language of publication may hinder public and policy makers from using the academic publications or reports.  \n- Do these two types of publications have policy component? And how are these used by the different decision makers?\n- Lavis et al. (2006) provides a framework to assess what should be transferred, to whom, by whom, how and with what effect using four strategies: push efforts by researchers or purveyors, user pull efforts, exchange efforts and finally integrated efforts. What are the most used strategies? And what would be the best to be used in the future?\n- Who are the potential user that is not an organized State but a multiplicity of international and national agencies that have their own agendas: ESCWA, world bank, UNRWA, plus all the foreign aid agencies. The "market" for knowledge is as compartimentalized as the research world.\n- Do academics, research centres and think tanks play an awareness role to public and advocacy and lobbying roles with policy makers in order to influence policy reforms? \nThe problems that we investigate do not concern only the social science but also natural and exact sciences. \nIn order to investigate the above questions we will use bibliometrics and content analysis of newspapers, social media and mass media and interview stakeholders involved in all the process.\n\nAbout the two issues: \n\nEducational reform: The past two education reforms in Lebanon (1994 post civil war and 2010), both emphasized the role of citizenship. \n\nPalestinian refugees’ status/situation: In 2005 the Lebanese-Palestinian Dialog Committee (LPDC) (among main funders is IDRC), to improve the lamenting situation of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. Since then a relentless literature was written in a format of academic writing, open source or not, and many reports were published, yet we see little impact on changing public opinion or decision concerning these refugees.   \nThe outcome of the research will be disseminated in three workshops first with the scholarly community and then with all stakeholders involved in education reform and in Palestinian refugees’ status/situation. \n\nImpact will be evaluated by assessing the quality of the debates generated in the three workshops and the changes in collaborative work between different stakeholders (in one and two years after implementation of the project.', 'The proposal will adopt a qualitative research methodology comprising bibliometrics (not only in English articles through WoS and Scopus but aslo E-marefa for Arabic and Cairn for French), a desk review, document analysis and individual in-depth interviews with academics and researchers, journalists, NGOs and INGO practitioners and policy makers, in order to understand their collaborative role in shaping education reform and Palestinian refugees problem. \n\nIn-depth analysis of 1994 and 2010 education reform strategies: \nWe will analyse the discourse on citizenship in the education strategies of 1994 and 2010 strategies including the priorities of these reforms but most importantly the preparatory work that proceeded the development including any white papers. We will also investigate the process of initiating this reform at the policy makers level including the selection of committee members, experts and civil servants to participate in this reform.  Finally, we will examine the negotiation and decision making process that took place during this reform including discussions with the donors, academics, think tanks and research institutes to define what constitutes citizenship empowerment and participation.  \n\nThe role of academics, researchers and think tanks: \nIn order to understand the role of academics, research institutes and think tanks in shaping policy reform agendas, we will conduct a bibliometric study and desk review of the main topic areas of books, reports and papers published by research institutes and academics in Lebanon during the period of 1990 up to now for the education reform and 2005 up to now for the Palestinian refugees issue. By identifying the issues of importance to the research community in Lebanon, we can compare it with the citizenship priorities of the two educational strategies (1994, 2010) and LPDC strategy in order to examine whether there are any synergies between the two groups. This analysis will be complemented by individual interviews with directors of research centres and academics at universities. \n\nThe role of the donors in influencing policy-making:\nThe IGO and INGOs as well as the World Bank have funded the two cases of education reforms. These organizations do not only fund the implementation of education strategies but also commission research driven by their own policy agendas. Hence they could play an important role in influencing and shaping policy makers in Lebanon. To understand their role, a desk review of reports and studies published by the above organizations will be carried out. Interviews with relevant key stakeholders in this sector will examine their perception of their role as well their involvement in the two reforms. \n\nThe Role of newspapers in generating debates:\nWe will do a content analysis of Lebanese newspapers looking after any article/debate concerning the two issues understudied. We will study who are the generators of the debates and whether scholarly community contributes to it.    \n\nThe fieldwork will be conducted by the project leaders as well as two research assistants to be hired for this project. Rigas Arvanitis a senior researcher from l’Institute de recherche pour le développement will be in charge of the bibliometrics.', 'The result of this research will be published in a form of report and disseminated widely through three workshops: \n- Workshop with scholarly community who contribute into literature on the two issues (education reform and Palestinian refugees status/situation in Lebanon). The objective is to have serious discussion about the gaps and the hurdles hindering knowledge translation. The issue of how to use open science without necessarily falling in the trap of what was called “predator” journals (are those that unprofessionally exploit the author-pays model of open-access publishing [Gold Open Access] for their own profit) will also be discussed. \n- Workshop with all stakeholders involved in education reform to discuss the initial findings and to consult how netweeking can be forster and policy can be reached \n- Workshop with all stakeholders involved in Palestinian refugees status/situation  to discuss the initial findings how netweeking can be forster and policy can be reached\nAll participants in this project are member of the consortium ODYSCE, a multi-institutional (AUB, LU, LCNRS, LAU, SJU) and multi-disciplinary team. They will use this consortium to help in the dissemination. \nWe will also publish article(s) in English and Arabic in order to disseminate the findings    \nWe expect the outcomes of the research and of these workshops will benefit tremendously OCSDNet as it will generate more synergy in the future and will orient IDRC in learning more about how its funded projects would better reach their objectives.\nWe should emphasize that we will generate data that goes beyond the issue of citizen empowerment and social sciences specialties (education field, Palestinian refugees) through process of extrapolation and conceptualization. These specialties are indeed similar with many national and exact sciences indicate that the university and the publication system are functioning differently in non-hegemonic countries, thus the issue of "open science" cannot be the same are in hegemonic countries. This "periphery" hypothesis is not fully explored: it relates to this proliferation of small centres outside university, migration of highly educated personnel, etc. Also we will carry out reflection on the scarcity of the multidiscplinary and interdsicipinary research not only in  Lebanon but in the whole Arab region and to reflect on a strange paradox: a lot of policy oriented research and very little in interdisciplinary research.', 'Impact will be evaluated through the following measurements:\n- assessing the content and the quality of the debates generated in the three workshops  \n- carrying out two evaluations in one year and the following year of changes in collaborative work between different stakeholders and whether knowledge translation process is better or not.', '79,530', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/scan0022.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudget.xlsx', 125, NULL, 'complete', 'yes', 1410175152, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, 'yes');

How literate are farmers in accessing ICT Tools for Agriculture in Ghana?\n9. The Role of Open and Collaborative Research in promoting Technology Transfer in Agriculture.\nThe rational and goal for our research project includes to identify if any the important role of good infrastructures and technologies in boosting agriculture in the Global South and also to fostering information and knowledge exchange among researchers and experts in the areas of food security and the promoting sustainable investments in the agriculture sector in the Global South.\nWhiles many national governments particularly have not been so much enthused in investing in the agriculture sector in Africa, this research project seeks to reveal new knowledge and information how basic yet useful infrastructure can boost the economies of countries whose economies are highly reliant on agriculture and to attracting much needed international and foreign investments in the agriculture sectors.\nThis research project will actively engage and study the important role of Open and Collaborative Research in knowledge production among experts and policy makers in the agriculture sector with key emphasis on food security for the global south.\nFarmers and stakeholders in the projects catchment communities will be trained and informed of the importance of information Communications Technologies in boosting agriculture production and food security as the project will expertly monitor and evaluate the impacts of skills and knowledge transfers in the agriculture communities who will be involved in these capacity building programmes during the seminars and meetings

alliance that seeks to attract private sector investments to seven targeted countries namely Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and Rwanda known as the Grow Africa Project which seeks development partnerships for investments in their agriculture sectors.\nOur research project which is the “e-Agri Transport Network” seeks to highlight and reveal useful details on the importance of Information Communications Technologies to the agriculture sector of Ghana and how strategic technological infrastructures could be a game changer in boosting agriculture in Africa whiles ensuring self sufficiency and food security in Ghana and Sub Sahara African.\nThis project also will bring to bare of the importance of Open and Collaborative Approaches to knowledge production as a successful model for setting the development  agenda and influencing government policy on agriculture whiles boosting private sector investments in selected and importance areas of the sector for sustainable development in Ghana and the global south as a whole.\nAgriculture accounts for roughly one-quarter of the GDP of Ghana and employs more than half of the national workforce who are mainly smallholder farmers and as a result useful research data and projects which has a potential to boosting investments and encouraging innovative agricultural approaches is of key interest to the Government of Ghana and its development partners.\nIn Ghana the Agriculture sector stepped up its contribution to total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the economy in the third quarter of 2013, the agricultural sector in monetary terms contributed GH?7,088 representing 30.4 per cent of the total value of goods and services produced in the country spanning the period, July to September 2013.\nThis project is also using an approach know as “Citizen Volunteers” in our research and projects activities which seeks to support the benefits and importance of the active participation of citizens in the planning and conducting of scientific research which we are confident to prove that it will be vital in enhancing the usefulness of the research outcome and also in addressing local development goals catchment and targeted communities and countries.\n\nAddressing issues of food security is a major priority for the government of Ghana  and many other Sub Saharan African countries hence the formation of the regional alliance on food security and encouraging innovations in approaches and researches including projects aimed at addressing agriculture investments and promoting development in the sector.\nOur project is targeting the Ghana Medium Term Agricultural Sector Investment Plan (METASIP) , this program has been set up the national government with the belief that agricultural growth can impact on the development of the entire country.\nOur research project will seek to address focus areas of the METASIP which is also our major areas of importance and goal of

The National Government recognizes the importance of biotechnology, especially in agricultural biotechnology as one of the key strategies in responding to the challenges of poverty, food insecurity and nutritional needs in harsh and changing climates not conducive for normal agricultural activities and sustainable livelihoods. Through the National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation (NACOSTI), the Ministry of Science and Technology’s umbrella policy making body, the Government regulates and addresses quality issues around biotechnology applications, use and its products. One of NACOSTI’s functions is to promote increased awareness, knowledge and information on research systems.\nThe Kenyan Biotechnology Information Centre (KEBIC) is a not-for-profit entity dedicated to building public understanding about biotechnology applications, use and its products. Formed 5 years ago, KEBIC has positioned itself as the national biotechnology communication, education and information outreach source in Kenya. KEBIC organizes a variety of activities targeted at specific stakeholders in and around Kenya to promote mutual understanding; engage the participation of the public and policy makers; and inspire the next generation to understand the potential opportunities and constraints especially in agricultural biotechnology, in responding to the challenges of poverty and food insecurity. \nKEBIC recently launched a website (early 2014) to complement its various outreach programmes and increase its coverage across a broad spectrum of target audiences. Known as the Biotechnology Awareness Programme (BAP), the programme aims to achieve a well informed and knowledgeable society that can make informed decisions on the use of biotechnology and its products through the use of current advancements in information and communication technology and cloud computing. The BAP is anchored on the premise that an ever increasing population of Kenyans, particularly the youth, is embracing the use of the internet and mobile technology in their everyday activities. Indeed, recent statistics indicate that a large majority of the Kenyan youth are using web-based resources as their primary source of information . The programme’s web design incorporates interactive social media such as Facebook and Twitter to promote discussions in the field of biotechnology among this category of Kenyans. The programme envisages that its geographic coverage will broaden over time to include sub-Saharan Africa and the wider African continent. \nIn recognizing the potential and significance of the BAP in promoting positive development outcomes in the field of agricultural biotechnology at national as well as county government levels, the Steering Committee seeks to collaborate with a research organization in subjecting the BAP to rigorous scientific research in order to better understand the factors that influence the success of the programme, the risk factors associated with the programme, and the associated risk mitigation measures. \nGiven that the BAP is in its exploratory stage, it is expected that the chosen research design will stretch over a period of at least 12 months in order to yield maximum learning from the programme. \nThe objective of the research study is to determine the effectiveness of the BAP in influencing knowledge, awareness and practices relating to biotechnology products and processes in Kenya. \nThe research questions to be answered are the following:\n1. What are the key strategies and factors that contribute to increased knowledge, awareness and practices relating to biotechnology products and processes in Kenya?\n2. What factors limit knowledge, awareness and practices relating to biotechnology products and processes in Kenya?\n3. Would outputs of the Biotechnology Awareness Programme lead to better understanding of local agricultural biotechnology issues and more autonomous decision making?\n4. How effective is the Biotechnology Awareness Programme as a stand-alone programme or when delivered in combination with other biotechnology programme interventions in meeting its programme objectives? \n5. Will the Biotechnology Awareness Programme lead to a redistribution of resources, labour, and policy focus? If so, what are the social, economic and political consequences of these changes?', 'It is proposed to conduct a longitudinal research. The BAP will provide the context for the development of the longitudinal research, acting as a case study, through enabling the researchers to establish a relationship with a specific group of participants interacting with the programme’s website. The researchers will draw inferences for the study from the knowledge, attitudes and behavioural tendencies of this group and seek their views on all aspects of the BAP including its general approach, strategies, outputs and outcomes. \nThe longitudinal research will be complemented by action research. The action research will combine learning from the actual programme implementation with the programme’s key performance indicators, planned outputs and outcomes. This will enable the researchers to determine the potential contribution of different strategies employed within the BAP to the achievement of outputs and outcomes. \nThe research will also pilot existing and/or new approaches to open and collaborative science currently not employed in the BAP, drawing on evidence from other related but more advanced fields, to establish the viability of these methodologies and what could also be applied to expand the scope of what is possible.  \nSpecifically, the following methodologies will be considered:\n(i) Desk review of key documentation, policies, strategies (internet searches, searches in grey literature, and local libraries). The review will first and foremost take a comparative approach, looking at common and diverging strategies and factors leading to changes within the BAP, and linking this back to the relevant Theory of Change. The review is planned to be mainly qualitative, but where necessary will involve quantitative data collection. The research team will deploy appropriate methodologies including comparative case studies, outcome harvesting, and critical stories of change as and when necessary.\n(ii) Collection of relevant baseline data for the BAP objectives and related key programme indicators to enable changes in knowledge, attitudes and practices relating to biotechnology products and processes in Kenya to be measured over the course of the research project. If deemed necessary, a baseline study design will be integrated into the overall research design to allow the identification of subjects that enable the research project to track key changes and effects amongst target groups from the baseline stage and at future points in time throughout the life of the BAP. \n(iii) Generation of additional primary data through in-depth exploration with the BAP staff and community stakeholders, by holding qualitative and quantitative interviews. Workshops and interviews will also be held with key stakeholders such as civil society organizations, or management groups, advisory and programme teams. Key informant interviews will be undertaken with key people who have been directly involved in implementing similar programmes from among key identified organizations and networks, and are involved in decision making within their organizations.  Sets of guiding questions will be developed for use during the interviews in order to ensure that the interviews remain focused and all the information required is collected. Focus group discussions (FGDs) will be conducted among groups where the identified organizations and networks are implementing their programmes, and to verify and counter-check information gathered during key informant interviews. Each FGD will comprise of between 6 to 8 persons invited due to their knowledge and involvement in programmes with an information and communication technology component. In order to allow for free flow of information on programming and to enable each group to express themselves freely without intimidation, especially women, where deemed necessary the groups will be further separated into groups of men and women.\n(iv) Research support into community building and awareness raising activities to increase uptake and participation in the BAP.\n\nData analysis will form a core element in this research study. The research team will seek to conduct the analysis based on the field data collected from the interviews and observations. Data will be analysed using Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis (CAQDAS) packages. The data will be disaggregated appropriately to allow for analysis based on the category of the partner network or organization, and a more focused analysis on the characteristics of the various respondent groups such as age groups (adults and youths aged 15 – 35), gender and social demographics (rural/urban).', 'The expected programme outcome from the BAP is a well informed and knowledgeable society that can make informed decisions on the use of biotechnology and its products. \n\nThe expected development-related outcome from the BAP is increased utilisation of agricultural biotechnology and its products in responding to the challenges of poverty and food insecurity.\n\nThe BAP provides a relevant case study within the context of OCSD Net’s broad aim to deepen our understanding of whether, and the conditions under which a converging set of open research practices could lead to development outcomes. It explores quality, meaningfulness and possible utility of openness and collaboration in science and development.\n\nThrough the BAP, the proposed study would lead to better understanding of the factors that contribute to increased knowledge, awareness and practices relating to biotechnology applications, use and its products and the associated local development issues. \n\nIt would also create opportunities for collaboration and linkages at county government levels within Kenya and dovetail into policy formulation processes at national level. This aspect is embedded in Kenya’s Vision 2020 which recognises the critical role of science, technology and innovation in accelerating economic growth in all newly industrialising countries of the world. \n\nSimilarly, the study would generate interest in terms of lessons learnt and best practices in the field of biotechnology beyond the African continent. Currently, statistics to the BAP website indicate visits by users drawn from USA, UK and some European Union countries.\n\nOther potential areas of utility from the proposed study at the global level include the following:\n(a) Contribution to the global vision to ensure food supply, environmental sustainability and economic opportunity through agriculture.\n(b) The extent to which the openness of the US-EU infrastructures contribute to benefits to development outcomes in the Global South.', 'The research project will be headed by the principal researcher, who will also be the project coordinator. She will also be responsible for the entire research, reporting and adherence to timelines. The research team will meet on a monthly basis. The research team’s involvement will start from the inception of the project so that they understand the research strategy to be used, have the opportunity to include questions of interest to the project as well as gaining an intimate understanding of the study approach themselves, and to ensure they are fully involved in the process of implementing the project at all stages. \nEach partner organisation will have a shared responsibility for managing activities within the project, including monitoring the progress of a specific activity against agreed objectives, budget and timelines, reporting any deviations and taking timely corrective actions. \nQuality and management issues relating to the project will be addressed using a common implementation, monitoring and evaluation framework. At the institutional level, a Memorandum of Understanding between the research organisation and the collaborating organisation will be developed based on relevant criteria such as purpose, duration, roles and responsibilities, payments, general provisions and signatures. \nAt the project management level, a monitoring and evaluation plan will help to define roles, responsibilities and activities among all the partners and relevant actors. It will establish the ground rules for managing the research project including the monitoring tools which will be used, the technical skills of the persons who will be assigned to collect the monitoring data, and the frequency of collection of monitoring data. Competent researchers – who, for example, can maintain meaningful relationships with the community on multiple levels, are competent to facilitate partnerships and follow participatory approaches to research, and are willing to learn from their partners – will be selected for the project. \nThe implementation, monitoring and evaluation framework will also play a role in sustaining the participants’ activities during the project implementation. Learning agreements will be discussed with participants before the start of the project.

They will need to do this in the context of a changing climate and volatile local and global socioeconomic conditions. This has particular implications for South Africa, which faced specific developmental challenge. These include: \n• High levels of food insecurity, roughly 13 million people in 2013 (Shisana et al. 2013) with high malnutrition rates in one of five children, resulting in lowered adult productivity (NPC 2011).\n• Predictions that changes in climate could result in a 30% decrease in production of the country’s staple maize crop, among other crops, by 2050 (IFPRI 2012; Sasson 2012).\n• Increasing biodiversity loss leading to ecosystem degradation (DAFF 2012), with the resultant implications for water generation and soil degradation (DEAT 2005). \n• The third highest youth unemployment rate in the world (Fin24.com 2014) – more than 50% of young South Africans between the ages of 15 and 24 years are unemployed. \n\nFood insecurity in South Africa is increasingly understood as a poverty problem opposed to a productivity problem (SSA 2012; Shisana et al. 2013). Price increases arising from volatile commodity speculation, climate change, deepening levels of poverty (Drimie & McLachlan 2013), rising input costs (SSA 2012), and constrained production environments (soil degradation) (DEAT 2005) threaten the country’s food security. \nSouth Africa has identified small-scale farming as a viable intervention point in that it would increase food production among the communities most in need, it will absorb additional labour, it will add to regional, community and household food security, and it will reduce biodiversity loss. However, these small-scale farmers will need training that enables them to become reflective, adaptive, innovative and productive in the face of multiple and interlinked social, economic and environmental challenges. \nThis research project aims to evaluate existing vocational training systems for sustainable/climate-ready food systems in South Africa to ascertain whether the courses:\n• Empower students to enter the realities of farming in South Africa.\n• Provide a holistic context for sustainable farming, including the challenges of a changing climate.\n• Train practitioners in reflectivity and participatory learning techniques. \n• Are grounded in sustainable farming techniques, including soil science. \n• Are results-orientated.\nIt will do this by investigating current training programmes, establishing a framework of practice, evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of these courses given the complex nature of farming in South Africa, test these notions with a group of young agricultural students at the Sustainability Institute and generate and distribute collectively gained knowledge about the types of systems needed and best practices within this field.\nReferences: \n• DAFF (2012).

The methodologies for the project are outlined below within an estimated time frame and research design. \nStage 1: January 2015–May 2015\nLiterature review: On training systems for agriculture to provide a broad framework of focus areas and a background of transitioning education on this area. \nDesktop research: Identifying and contacting existing vocational training systems focused on sustainable/climate-ready food systems – including informal systems, for example, non-governmental organisations running regular agricultural skills training initiatives.  Requesting copies of curriculums, annual reports and any other relevant documentation. \nParticipatory learning/action research: Focus group discussions with the existing students at the Sustainability Institute’s Agroecology College to ascertain their existing knowledge, gaps in this knowledge and what they perceive as important aspects of their training. \nThese three approaches will inform the initial formulation of survey and interview questionnaires. \nJune 2015–September 2015\n• Reviewing existing curriculums, annual reports and other gathered documentation.\n• Compiling an initial framework of focus areas and intended outcomes of curriculums.\n• Refining survey and interview questionnaires.\nParticipatory learning/action research: During this entire period, the researcher will meet on a regular basis with the aforementioned students in a facilitated and semi-structured environment to test findings and further refine the framework. These sessions will allow for reflectivity and on-going learning on the part of the researcher and the student research participants. While sessions will offer the researcher immediate feedback and opportunity to discuss arising issues and findings with future practitioners thus elevating the study from theory to practical application, the student research participants will increase their own knowledge, generate new knowledge and inject a broader, theoretical understanding into their practical work. In this way, the generated knowledge is not contained in the core focus of the project, but extends through the student research participants into their lives and own networks. \nOctober 2015–March 2016\nField research: Visiting the institutions and organisations to administer surveys and interview questions. Compiling gathered information into the framework. \nParticipatory learning/action research: The sessions mentioned in the previous stage continue during this period. \nSeptember–December 2016\n• Finalising the framework.\n• Writing a best-practice guide. \n• Distributing material for feedback. \n• Establishing on-line portals for continued exchange of knowledge between institutions.\n• Publishing and distributing material.', 'The primary output of the project will be an evaluation of vocational training systems focused on sustainable/climate-ready food systems. This framework will provide information on the content of courses, practical work, student demographics, placement opportunities, funding challenges, world-views of teachers and students and linkages between institutions and institutions and the state. From this framework it should be possible to identify areas for collaboration between parties and opportunities for transferring knowledge more effectively. It is expected that a set of best-practice guidelines will emerge from the study, which can be freely distributed to participating institutions and feed into curriculums and policy. \nKnowledge generation outputs include: \n• A holistic understanding of the existing systems of agricultural training in South Africa. \n• An outline of how many systems focus on training for climate-ready food systems, their location, funding, approach and uptake. \n• A nuanced understanding of the ways in which climate change is understood within these systems.\n• Knowledge on the expectations of institutions and future practitioners. \n• Potential inputs into government policy linking agriculture, vocational training and youth employment. \nSpecific outputs are: \n• A framework evaluating vocational training systems for climate-ready food systems in South Africa. \n• A best practice guide for institutions and organisations providing such training. \n• An online platform for further collaboration between institutions and research participants. \nDevelopment outputs:\nThe ultimate beneficiaries of the project would be student-practitioners if the results of the study were incorporated into curriculums and outlooks of involved institutions. In addition, the study would provide a valuable evaluation tool for curriculums and enable their alignment with the country’s National Development Plan and other relevant policies. The study will add to existing knowledge on South Africa’s agricultural system and provide valuable input into youth employment strategies.', 'The group of student research practitioners from the Agroecology College will fulfil the primary monitoring and evaluation function. Their sustained engagement through the regular forum meetings, feedback through structured sessions and surveys and ongoing learning will attest to the relevance of the project. \nDelivering on outputs within the stipulated time frames and allowing space for reflectivity will also keep the project on track.

However, sesame seed-based foods (sesame paste, tahini, sesame-based halva, etc.) have been sources of Salmonella outbreaks. The varied sources of Salmonella contamination are classified as pre-harvest (soil, animal and human feces, irrigation water, reconstituted fungicides and insecticides, dust, insects, inadequately composted manure, wild or domestic animals and human handling) or post-harvest ( farm equipment, transport containers,  processing equipment, and human handling). The high lipid component in sesame seed-based foods, in similar way peanut butter and chocolate, provides protection for Salmonella through the stomach acid barrier after consumption, and therefore even very low levels present a risk to the consumer. \nNew USFDA and EU requirements for total management control of products mean more oversight forces companies to avoid Salmonella contamination of their products.  Subsequently, many countries are introducing measures to:\n• identify possible hazards associated with each ingredients and final product; \n• perform risk-based activities to verify that each exported food item is consistent with national standards before sale.\n• conduct periodic reassessments of the Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) and maintain an importer ID numbers.\nTahini and other sesame-based products are critically important exports for the economy of Lebanon and other Middle East countries. For Ethiopia, the risk of rejection and subsequent loss of foreign exchange from sesame seed export is a great concern. Thus, a systematic analysis as to the risk of prevalence and the sources of Salmonella contamination in these two countries is timely and relevant. \n\nThis study seeks to generate enhanced insights in the prevalence of Salmonella in the production and delivery practices of smallholder sesame farmers in Ethiopia as well as in sesame-based products processors in Lebanon. Much of this is unknown at present, and based on studies of other seed products such as alfalfa seeds as used for sprouts may be internalized in the sesame fruiting body as it develops. All this leads to our aim to analyze the willingness of smallholder sesame farmers to adopt Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and avoid any Salmonella and other pathogen contamination. \n\nThe study aims to addresses the following research questions:\n1. How is the sesame seed supply chain organized in Ethiopia? \n2. What is the prevalence of risk factors for Salmonella contamination in sesame seed in the present production and delivery systems in Ethiopia?\n3. What are the main sources and frequency for Salmonella contamination due to pre- and post-harvest practices of sesame farmers and distribution systems in Ethiopia?\n4. What is the likelihood of Salmonella contamination from facilities processing sesame-based products in Lebanon?\n5. What is the willingness of smallholder sesame farmers to adopt Good Agricultural Practices and processers to implement appropriate HACCP plans?\n\nAnswering these research questions will lead to collaborative science between industry and academic and between countries along the food chain.  By combining observational studies, laboratory tests and choice experiments, this study contributes to theme 4 of the OCSD thematic areas.\n\nThe study aspires to tackle several development challenges such as:\n\n• Health equity – Many international Salmonella outbreaks and recalls have been correlated to the consumption of tahini and tahini-based products. \n• Food security– Food insecurity is a major problem for many Ethiopians, being closely linked to lack of sufficient cash to buy certain commodities in time of food shortage during the year. It is expected that delivery of safe sesame seeds will lead to enhanced price and access to the international market enabling households to have sufficient money to buy food in some months they frequently experience food shortages. Conversely, if they are not able to address traceability requirements in their production and delivery practices, their sesame seeds will not be accepted, and thus can fall into the poverty trap.\n• Climate change – Sesame is one of the most important sources of foreign exchange for Ethiopian and one the most drought tolerant crops in the world using less water than cotton, sorghum, millet, or corn. It is a preferred crop of smallholder farmers residing in semi-arid areas of Ethiopia and other African countries. As the risk of drought increases with global warming, farmers in these areas are more likely to shift to growing sesame seeds more than other crops. But this increases their risk if sesame seeds become recalled due to Salmonella contamination. Thus, it crucial that these farmers have adequate knowledge on the critical production and delivery practices that they should follow to satisfy traceability requirements and to deliver Salmonella free product to Lebanon processors and others.', 'The Ethiopian study will be carried out in the highly sesame growing regions  – Humera, North Gondar and Wellega.  40 sesame seed farmers from each of the three regions will be randomly selected and samples will be collected. Furthermore, to assess potential risks from the delivery systems in Ethiopia, major actors in sesame seed supply chain leading up to the export market will be assessed.\nTo answer the first research question, the organization of sesame seed supply chain in Ethiopia, a qualitative study to be led by the PI will be carried out in June and July, 2015.  In the study, the various steps /actors involved/ along the food chain – from input supply up to the delivery of sesame seed to the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange and then to exporters – and the role of the different actors involved in the chain will be described. In addition, the type of coordination mechanism (trust based, contractual or other form) that are being used to govern relationships between different actors along the food chain will be studied. \nTo answer research questions 2 to 4, the following methodology will be followed. \nContamination of sesame seed by Salmonella often is sporadic, and detecting the presence of this requires taking relatively high number of samples.  Thus, for each farmer, 3 sesame seed samples of 25g each will be aseptically collected and appropriately stored, transported and analyzed at American University of Beirut (AUB). At the same time, environmental samples – soil, water and equipment (swabs) - will be collected for and analyzed at AUB.\nThe sesame seed samples from the three sesame growing regions in Ethiopia will be analyzed first as composite samples (12.5g*40*3), and if any found positive for Salmonella and/or fecal coliform the remaining will be analyzed to determine farm sources.\nIn addition, 10 samples of 250g will be collected from exporters’ shipment in Addis Ababa and shipped to AUB for possible Salmonella and E. coli contamination due to post-harvest handling/delivery systems in January-March, 2015.\nTo identify sources of possible Salmonella internalization contamination of maturing seeds, 50 heads of near mature sesame plants for each region will be collected in August-September 2015 and shipped to AUB for laboratory analysis.\nFor the facility test, samples will be collected from the equipment being used by sesame-based food processors in Beirut and taken to AUB for laboratory analysis. \nAll Salmonella strains from the different samples will be characterized by molecular methods to demonstrate their sources.\nTo help us systematically implement the research design, three trained personnel at Master’s level will be hired for the three sesame growing regions.  Furthermore, the PI will dedicate two months (June and July, 2015) in Ethiopia to make sure that maximum care is given in collecting samples. \nFinally, we plan to analyze the willingness of sesame farmers to adopt Good Agricultural Practices (GAP).  Attempts by the food industry to codify, implement and sometimes impose ‘GAP’ codes of practices on farmers has raised the question of the extent to which the markets can support sustainable agriculture, how the value-added is distributed in these schemes through the food chain, whether farmers benefit and with what transaction costs, and whether a large proportion of consumers at the end of the chain are willing to pay for sustainable agriculture through such schemes. Thus, in this study, all the participating 120 sesame growers will be invited to a one-day training workshop and will be provided sufficient information about the costs and benefits of adopting GAP. Subsequently, a systematically designed questionnaire will be given to the farmers to elicit their preferences under the supervision of the PI and RAs. In addition, other socio-economic and demographic variables will be collected to further analyze whether the propensity to adopt GAP or not is affected by these variables.  \nAs part of the implementation processes, we plan to give an intensive five days GAP training for about 30 people consisting of agriculture experts, traders, middlemen and concerned bodies from the Quality Assurance Authority of Ethiopia.  In addition, the Co-PI will work with the Lebanese processors to develop appropriate HACCP plans. \nWe believe the design and methodologies in this cross-country collaborative type of research will greatly support the ideals of OCSDNet. The study aspires to define risk of Salmonella contamination in sesame seed and sesame-based products, determine the relative value of different interventions along the food chain, make prioritized risk management decisions on appropriate Salmonella control measures across the food chain, and design and implement an effective monitoring and review program.', 'This study is expected to have the following development outcomes\n• The sesame seed food chain will be mapped from farm to processor. A value chain map illustrates and provides a clear understanding for stakeholders the way the sesame seeds flow from raw material to export markets, the various actors of the chain, and their linkages. This will create a shared understanding among value chain stakeholders of the current situation of the industry, and is a critical step to satisfy traceability requirements.\n• Risk and sources for Salmonella contamination at farm and processing levels will be identified. This will alert policymakers and other stakeholders along the food chain to take preventive measures and minimize the risk of Salmonella contamination and subsequent recalls of sesame seeds. \n• Risk management strategies will be developed to minimize the risk of Salmonella contamination.  Salmonella risk management strategy will help as a tool for policy and other stakeholders to regularly monitor effective operation of sesame seed safety systems, and minimize Salmonella outbreaks and recalls. Eventually, such strategies will help sesame growers to open up access to regional and international markets and processors to implement appropriate HACCP plans.  \n• Sesame seed farmers’ willingness to adopt Good Agricultural Practices and processors to develop HACCP plans will be determined. Knowledge on international quality and safety standards by smallholder farmers is crucial for policymakers to design appropriate intervention. \n• Capacity of 30 district agriculture experts and other stakeholders in Ethiopia will be enhanced on Good Agricultural Practices and other traceability requirements in the global market. Human capital is a key to successfully promote the importance of GAP and implement quality and safety requirements. To be able to address a large number of sesame growers and other stakeholders in the food chain, it is important to enhance the capacity of agricultural experts and other stakeholders who closely work with these farmers on a regular basis. \n• The practice in Ethiopia can be exported to other Sub Saharan African (SSA) countries such Kenya, Sudan and Uganda. Currently, Ethiopia and Sudan combined lead the international sesame seed market. Most countries in the SSA region have similar production practices and delivery systems. We have already support from Kenya where sesame seed has gained importance particularly in the western and coastal region of Kenya. Mr. Peter Obimbo Lamuka, from Food Science and Technology at University of Nairobi, Kenya, will participate in the stakeholders’ workshop that we plan to hold in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.', 'The expected outcomes will be monitored (through regular follow up in research sites and assess outcomes and adjust plans, as needed). The capacity development training that will be given to different stakeholders, the implementation guideline and risk management tools that will be developed will all help to make this project sustainable and successful and the impact meaningful. As part of monitoring and evaluation, we plan to carry out a stakeholders’ workshop in January 2016. The expected outcome of this project will be to discuss the findings, implementation guidelines and risk management strategies as well as to evaluate achievements in both farm and process environments so the whole food chain from sesame seed to tahini is under control. The long term impact of these interventions should be for future evaluators beyond this particular study.', '79796', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/Letter_of_Endorsement3.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudgetProposal3.xlsx', 109, NULL, 'complete', 'yes', 1410185525, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, 'yes'),

In the Rwenzori region, attempts have been made to propose and implement a regional platform for planning and proposing a development agenda for the region. It is unclear whether the planning and decision making is based on research and especially on the practices of open and collaborative science. What is evident is that there various ongoing development interventions and researches mainly spearheaded by Civil Society Organizations and academic institutions at local and regional levels. Experiences in the region show that at the local level people hold traditional beliefs which refrain them from divulging information during research. There are various incidents reported in the Rwenzori mountains where local people have vandalized meteorological equipment intended to minor climate change trends due to beliefs that the equipment was placed on places considered to be homes of their mountain gods. Such beliefs are barriers to OCS practices. Also despite the availability of a regional platform with over 50 member organizations for planning and proposing a development agenda the current practices show that those organizations are still operating with limited collaboration and sharing of researched information to inform each others activities. \n\nThis project is aimed at answering the following broad research questions: What traditional beliefs influence divulging and sharing of information at the local level in the Rwenzori region? What incentives and motivations are needed to break those barriers? Have past and present practices of researchers influenced local people’s openness to divulging information during research? To what extent have the current research practices of Civil Society Organizations and academic institutions integrated OCS at different levels of information gathering and dissemination? What factors underlie the current extent of OCS practices of stakeholders in the Rwenzori region? What benefits and limitations are associated with OCS practices in the socio-economic and cultural context of the Rwenzori region? What holistic conceptual and operational framework would support the OCS in the Rwenzori region?\n\nIt is anticipated that these questions shall enable the generation of information to tackle the development challenges of the Rwenzori region. The Rwenzori region is dominated by smaller holder farmers who depend on rain fed agriculture. The mountains terrain of the region coupled with climate change makes the region a fragile environment susceptible to landslides. Therefore, open collaborative research is necessary if these problems are to be mitigated through regular monitoring and sharing of timely and reliable information.', 'The research shall be conducted at two levels: 1) the micro (local) level and meso (regional) levels under three phases.\n\nPhase 1\nThe research shall mainly design shall involve stakeholder mapping of organizations and individuals that are involved in research in various areas in the Rwenzori region. Interviews shall be conducted with the identified stakeholders to assess their research practices (including dissemination of researched information), the local areas where they operate and the extent to which it integrates the principles of OCS. This shall be followed by field visits to local areas. Another set of interview schedule shall be used to obtain information from local participants about the cultural beliefs and practices and other factors that hinder divulging information during research and motives and incentives needed to break the identified hindrances. Both at the micro and meso level the participants shall be engaged in a reflective process on their perspectives on the limitations and opportunities of sharing research information.\n\nPhase 2\nInformation emanating from Phase 1 shall be analyzed and the results used in two ways:\n 1.

The role playing game game shall involve players who take on different role in the process of research and dissemination of information. The players may include but not limited to: information givers (participants or subjects), the researcher, the data analysis, the author of a publication, the policy makers and other people that utilize the information such as the small holder farmers. Different scenarios shall be simulated to ascertain what happens under different conditions when there is collaboration among the player and when there is no collaboration. The entire process shall take into account the socio-economic, cultural and demographic context of the Rwenzori region.

Where transparency and accountability mechanisms are weak or lacking, the needs of the poor are marginalised and funds intended for services such as health and education are at risk of being misused (TIU, 2011).  Despite the improvements registered in the health status in Uganda such child mortality rate, maternal mortality rate, infant mortality rate, total fertility rate, contraceptive rate. The performance on some of the key indicators is still wanting.  For example, the maternal mortality ratio has not significantly changed over the last seven years—stands at 438 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births (UDHS, 2011). Although infant mortality have shown improvement in the last one decade (from 88 deaths to 54 deaths per 1,000 live births between the 2000-01 UDHS and the 2011 UDHS), it is still unacceptably high — One in every 19 Ugandan children dies before the first birthday, and one in every 11 children dies before the fifth birthday (UDHS, 2011).\nAlthough there have been improvements in education sector especially in respect to enrollment for primary education from about 2.7 million in 1996 to 7.96 million in 2008 (NDP, 2010/11 –2014/15), concerns have been raised about the continuing poor quality of education.\n\nCorruption in Uganda is endemic within the public sector (IGG 2010).  The Corruption Perception Index (2013) ranks Uganda as the 140th most corrupt country in the world with a corruption perception index score of 26.  In most line ministries and local governments, private interests may take precedence over government ones as some officers abuse public resources or use their positions to flaunt procedures (ibid) Instead of subsiding, corruption seems to be growing as evidenced by the Global Fund and GAVI scandal where money for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, prevention of malaria and immunisation of children among others was abused (TIU, 2011). According to the NSDS (2008), there was no action taken on 40% of cases involving abuse of funds in the health sector.  As is the case in the health sector, 35%, 23.1% and 33.8% of the cases involving misuse of funds in primary education, sub-counties and local councils respectively went unpunished (Minsitry of Public Service and UBOS, 2008). \nOf recent Uganda has experienced more sophisticated corruption scandals involving syndicates of organized networks among public servants from different ministries. For example, funds meant for the rehabilitation and resettlement of the Northern Region whose communities were adversely affected by war for almost 20 years have been mismanaged.  This corruption scandal cumulated into the suspension of AID by a number of western Countries. In addition, communities have not been adequately mobilized and organized to demand for access to information and accountability for fund budgeted and disbursed for basic social services such as health and education. \n\nThis project shall be designed as one of the interventions to address this gap.  The main thrust of the project is “to put the power to change in the hands of the citizens.” This innovative and catalytic programme has an integrated, participative approach that targets the highly urban and rural areas of and Uganda. This project has several components including; the development of ICT-tools, training for journalists, human rights activists and government officers on how to monitor government funds and claim human rights to education and health care. \n\nThe project aims at contributing to an informed and open debate on corruption and mismanagement of government funds in Uganda.  The project also seeks to strengthen journalists, human rights activists, government officers and citizens in their capacity to monitor government spending, tracking suspected misallocation of government funding.', 'The study should employ a mixed methods design employing both quantitative and qualitative research approaches.

(49, 'Science Hack Day is an event that unites scientists, innovators, designers, and people with interesting ideas, in one place for a short but intense period of collaboration to « hack » and create extraordinary inventions.\nIn Madagascar, the first edition of Science Hack Day happened in the capital city, Antananarivo, in the premises of the Center for Scientific and Technical Documentation and Information (CIDST) during two consecutive days, on August 09 and 10, 2014. This would not have been possible without the financial partnership of Thomson Reuters EndNote and the leadership of CIDST-HABAKA, and gathered 71 participants, of which 8 women (11,26%) and 63 men (88,74%). Age bracket ranges from 16 to 51 with an average of 25.53. The youngest participant is a 16-year-old schoolgirl. \nAt the end of the event, appreciation by participants revealed their interest and enthusiasm. They unanimously expressed their satisfaction and wished for a serial organization of the event. Initiators thus suggest to replicate the event in the other five Faritany, for instance Fianarantsoa, Toamasina, Mahajanga, Toliara and Antsiranana.\n\nObjective of the Projet \nDecentralizing Science Hack Day (SHD) will benefit to creators, innovators and researchers in the five Faritany* as it will value their creativity in various fields (sciences, technology, art) and this, in a collaborative way.\n\n*Faritany: Administrative division corresponding to a province.  Madagascar  consists of six Faritany including 22 regions, each of which is divided into districts. \nSpecific objectives \n• To Transfer SHD Antananarivo’s experience to main towns of other Faritany ; \n• To value results of Malagasy researches; \n• To promote science and innovation in main towns of Faritany ; \n• To increase the number of people able to conduct and ensure the continuing of SHD events in their town ;', 'DECENTRALIZATION OF SCIENCE HACK DAYS IN MADAGASCAR', 'Madagascar', '1. What is the main problem and why is it important ? \n In Madagascar, culture for science and innovation is still modest, fragmented, and with limited opening to the public and the world of production. To become a driving force of development, science has to be accessible to everyone and allow people from various fields to contribute to its development and also to participate in finding new ways of interacting. \n\nIn Madagascar, alongside the scientific community (Higher Education, national research centers, …) which conduct scientific activities with tangible results, there is another community of innovators and creators from various fields working in the shadows but which deserves to be valued, as it carries new concepts with the ability to considerably influence the relationship between the world of production, the scientific community, and the general public.                            \n\n2. What is the main job linked to this sector? \n The first edition of SHD in Madagascar revealed the ability of young people to create and innovate to find solutions to most crucial problems in Madagascar, such as : fighting against locust invasion with an ultra-sound-emitting monostatic radar. Note that locust invasion caused a loss of 25% on national rice production in 2012-2013 ; fighting insecurity by equipping guard dogs with a sensor connected to a computer or an Android smartphone. This latter is a revolutionary concept as insecurity remains an important question in a country where 03 policemen ensure the security of 3,000 inhabitants whereas the international security standard requires 03 policemen for 1,000 inhabitants.  \nSome participants without any formal scientific background were able to present their project entitled Solar Stove, consisting of using solar energy for cooking, and using very simple materials such as cardboard, aluminum sheet and a mirror. This solution is economical and affordable, in a country where 80% of the population use firewood or charcoal for cooking. \nThese outputs are now exploited as part of the deployment of activities of the Malagasy Institution for Innovation (IMI), under the Ministry of Industry, Small and Medium-Sized Businesses in the form of a Maker Space where SHD participants can practice over the year the “DIY culture”.\nIt was also the opportunity for the majority of participants to learn handling electronic components by « Arduino », which they have never used before.  \nThe event was reported through social networks and the official website of CIDST: www.cidst.gov.mg; several daily papers and TV stations also covered the event. \nNote that a roundtable was organized prior the event on the topic « Science-Education-Research-Development ». This served to raise awareness among national public and private decision-makers', 'The CIDST has the attribution to promote innovation and creativity, and this, by valuing and distributing scientific and technical information. They work with Habaka and collaborate alongside different partners for the implementation, for instance universities and colleges, public and private research centers and institutions, chambers of commerce, business clustering and consortiums, ministries and decentralized local authorities.\n\nThe organization of the first SHD in Antananarivo has been the collective effort of CIDST and the NGO HABAKA. \nThis experience allowed us to point out that science is not only reserved reserved to the world of higher education and researches, but can also open to the general public, which constitutes a nursery for creativity and innovation. In this scope, the CIDST has always prioritized sharing and distribution of science and knowledge all over Madagascar.  Yet, generally speaking, scientific events and research institutions are centralized in the capital city. Creating the opportunity to « creators, designers, developers, scientists, and anyone with an interesting idea » from other Faritany to gather, collaborate and create new concepts, can help break that inequality.  \nRatozamanana Harinjaka, Executive Manager of the NGO HABAKA is the initiator and main organizer of the first edition of Science Hack Day Madagascar which took place in Antananarivo. His participation at SHD San Francisco incited him to promote the event in Madagascar.\n\n4. Which approach should be taken? \nIn order to make SHD in Faritany’s main towns more effective than the first edition of Antananarivo, two points are to be looked at: a calendar of the Director of SHD and a guide giving the instructions open to the public regarding the organization of SHD in the five main towns of the Faritany. The next steps are contained in the calendar of the Director of SHD Madagascar: \n• Identifying the five future local promoters of the event. \nThe selection procedure to identify these latter is the following : \n- The project manager will proceed to each Faritany’s main town for the awareness campaign : consultation meeting with local authorities, institutions and media, conferences ;\n- Selection will be based on leadership, motivation and open-mindedness ; \n- Applicants will send their resumé and cover letter mentioning the targeted public and the potential companies to sponsor or support the event ; \n\n• Training workshop for the 5 future local SHD event promoters, in order to provide instructions on how to organize a successful event in their town, based on the experience from the first edition. In addition, instructions on the creation of SHD will be available online ; \n\n• Launching of a call for expression of interest through local media. This is done to help promote the events and thus reach as large a public as possible.  \n\n•  Organization of the SHD event by local promoters under the coordination of the Director of SHD Madagascar. The event will take place in each main town of the Faritany. One hundred (100) participants at each SHD. \n\n• Documents on the success of the events and prototypes will be posted on Wiki and other blogs ; \n\nThe main roles of the director of SHD will be to encourage people to create SHD events in their town and to act as a mentor to promoters in the process of organizing SHD.', 'The SHD will become a recognized and indispensable national craze, organized in several towns.

Additionally he has developed continent wide short term trainings in environmental journalism, governing extractive industries, sustainability urban Africa and environmental leadership. His current work includes capacity development and curricula design for sustainable natural resources management in Africa. This includes work by UNU-INRA (United Nations University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa) to strengthen academic/research capabilities in the continent and develop guidelines and instruments to make Africa self-reliant in academic-research-policy continuum for sustainable natural resources management.', 'Building Capacity for Sustainable Development Diplomacy in Africa', 'Sub-Sahran Africa', 'Efforts for sustainable development, globalization and developmental partnership have resulted in a growing African demand for negotiating capacity. Rapidly increasing global interests to invest in Africa compounded with continent’s poor position of advantage, result imbalanced power of negotiation with profound impacts on economic, ecologic and social development. This project aims to explore the limitations of Africa’s negotiation capacities entail in sustainable development of the continent. The research team consists of researchers and academicians and builds on a previously UNU-INRA initiated, SDD capacity building, with collaborators within and outside UNU-INRA. Our aim is to conduct capacity need assessment to formulate postgraduate curriculum, to improve negotiation capacity. Attention to critical need of negotiators will support high quality pan-African curriculum. We will collaborate with continental, regional and national organizations to represent diverse interests, and to integrate empirical data for capacity development planning. That is, to create links between critical need, prevailing capacity and curriculum implementation. Although the project will collect original data of need assessment at different scales, action is also needed through developing curriculum implementation framework. Thus, the project emphasizes the need for integrated research, policy and action approach.', 'The planned project consists of a combination of research and action aims. A central ambition it to improve on existing SDD knowledge and develop strong capacity, and the project will include methods and research tools such as questioner surveys, archival research and group discussion. If we are to improve our capacity to react wisely to ongoing and potential partnerships we need a better understanding the skills of negotiations. Within this broad agenda we will focus on a) critical need assessment b) prevailing capacity and c) curriculum implementation. We will focus on Sub Saharan Africa, one of the regions where rapid economic growth and resources endowment attract international land investments, resource extraction interests, trade collaboration and technology transfer, and where uneven power relations risk increasing social ecological vulnerability. \n  \nDetermine the critical size of negotiators to formulate curriculum on SDD. A continental need assessment is important for curriculum planning on SDD capacity development, but it is imperative that prevailing and anticipated subject specialization, number of negotiators and level of expertise are addressed. Issues on sustainable development are continuously negotiated including trade, climate, water, land and biodiversity. Apart from limited number of experts, such negotiations are constrained by lack of common voice, weak institutional backstopping and inadequate knowledge about the state of Africa’s natural resources. We aim to measure the prevailing and emerging demand for African SDD experts in reactive and proactive manners. Reactively, to envision how to build capacity that can solve the existing demand and proactively, to look ahead in developing capacity for anticipated demand. Outlining the state of SDD capacity and drawing implantation plan to bridge the capacity gap will form a major task of the research team. This will include obtaining representative and precise data for the continent covering different regions and nations retrieved from this project as well as from already existing data. We will apply various survey methods to quantify and qualify critical needs and group discussion approaches that lay the foundation for improved analytical tools for an integrated assessment of data at different scales. A questioner survey will be developed and used 1) to identify the critical capacity need to determine number of negotiators to train and formulate appropriate curriculum, 2) for production of knowledge products including a policy brief and a working paper, and 3) for development of curriculum implementation.\n\nSDD knowledge management, curriculum formulation and implementation. As regards sustainable development for Africa’s economical, ecological, social and governance decisions, empirically founded capacity development plan is of importance.  Within this project we will improve the analysis on existing knowledge from prevailing negotiation mechanisms and develop new strategic direction. By contrasting states of portfolio data utilized for negotiations, in cooperation with continental and regional organizations, we will examine rate of negotiation successes. This is of fundamental interest for understanding of state of knowledge behind negotiation mechanisms, for developing portfolio data structure, as well as for the formulation and implementation of curriculum. Organizations for extended investigation include AU, UNECA, ECOWAS, SADC and IGAD. Preliminary investigation on organizations has shown that there are limitations with regards to water, climate change and biodiversity negotiations. To overcome the limitations we will improve knowledge, tailor curriculum and plan implementation by archival study methods and curriculum review processes.', 'Upon successful completion this project will produce knowledge products, policy framework and curriculum document.  These products will emphasize critical need of negotiators, required SDD skills, status of portfolio data, and favourable institutional framework. SDD curriculum document will be refined with regards to objectives, graduate profile, course design, expected carrier outcomes and admission requirement. The results of the project will help the continent to best prepared for the growing prominence of globalization, transgression of planetary boundaries and emerging global agenda of sustainable development goals.  This is particularly important during this time when Africa is forging partnership with global players for direct foreign investment, trade, technology transfer, resource extraction and land acquisitions. Expert needs, intuitions and organizational setup ultimately negotiation capacity will reinforce sustainable development in the continent. SDD will add value to indigenous knowledge; optimize goods and services of biodiversity; assist adaptation and mitigation of climate change; and facilitate resource conflict management. \nThe following specific results are anticipated: 1) Identify capacity gap of negotiation through critical need assessment for expert negotiators and portfolio data. Develop negotiation capacity by formulating curriculum and implementation strategy 2) Enhanced capacity at UNU-INRA and partner OUs capable of implementing SDD curriculum 3) Improved availability of research based knowledge and linkage between policy and action for developing negotiation capacity in Africa. The following are the expected outputs of the project: 1) Curriculum document containing tailor-made modules/courses will be formulated 2) Journal articles on SDD will be published in international journals 3) Policy brief pertaining the state of SDD in Africa', 'UNU-INRA’s Africa wide vision and mandate makes it appropriate to implement the proposed project. The project will be conducted by high highly qualified research team members composed of: senior lecturers and academic and research leaders having strong research track-record representing Francophone and Anglophone Africa.\n\nVarious measures will be employed to insure project completion on the proposed schedule; according to anticipated quality; and fulfilling planned capacity development. \n\nCritical need assessment and module/course design: The proposed project will compile the challenges and opportunities of SDD negotiations at the regional organizations of the continent including AU, UN-ECA, ECOWAS, SADC and, IGAD. Unique and common issues for these organizations should constitute the scope of the research. The critical need assessment survey and gap analysis will help to scope the specific curriculum subjects under SDD and modules/courses for each subject.\n\nCollaborative Research: the project will evaluate SDD issues based on Africa’s geographic regions, language divisions, natural resources base categories and developmental partnerships. All the five regional organizations should be studied separately and a study report each will be published within the study period. The reports will also help refine the quality of the already proposed draft curriculum to be able to address the genuine SDD need of the continent. Synthesis of these reports should generate new knowledge to inform policy and should be of good quality to be published in an internationally per-reviewed journal. \n\nCapacity development and Action: The project will focus largely on pan-African capacity development through SDD curriculum design and implementation strategies of the curriculum. One curriculum review workshop in each of the five UNU-INRA operating unit countries (Senegal, Cameroon, Cote d’ivoire, Namibia and Zambia) should be conducted. At least two universities in the continent preferably one each from francophone and Anglophone countries should be able to adopt this curriculum and implement it.', '80000', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/OCSD-Endorsment_Letter-Gessesse_Dessie_08-09-2014.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSD-budget-Gessesse_Dessie-08-09-20142.xlsx', 2, 0, 'complete', 'yes', 1411283931, '', '', '', 0, '', 'yes'),
(51, 'The principal researcher is a highly skilled policy analyst with expertise in agricultural value chains analysis and institutional review and development and innovation studies. These skills will be crucial in conducting the proposed study as on one hand we want to understand how actors collaborate in a value chain to generate value and what an optimal institutional arrangement of the various actors is so that they can foster a spirit of collaboration, innovation and thus value creation.  \n\nThe researcher is currently running a project that is conducting a total of 20 agricultural value chain studies across 5 countries. The studies done on sorghum and Millet in Kenya and Uganda and cassava in Ghana have motivated this proposal.   Previously he led 8 value chain studies that were the basis of the Chapter on agro-processing in the Africa Transformation Report (ATR). http://africantransformation.org/wpcontent/uploads/2014/02/2014-african-transformation-report.pdf\n\nThe researcher is also currently part of a team that is working on a book to show case innovations in Africa. The initial findings were presented at the 1st Africa Innovation Summit (http://www.africainnovationsummit.com/index.php/en/). The researcher is writing on “Cassava driven innovations: Case of Ghana and Nigeria”.\n\nIn terms of institutional review experience, the researcher has been involved in a number of studies including, the institutional review and strengthening of the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) of Ghana, and the institutional review and restructuring of the Office of the President of Sierra Leone. In both these undertaking a thorough organizational and institutional review was done and recommendation for strengthening the institution done. The reform of NDPC is ongoing while the reform of office of the president of Sierra Leone is now complete.\n\nCollaboration will be sought from Dr. Chrispus Odouri (from KALRO), a subject matter expertise in millet and sorghum value chains. He has a deep understanding of the technologies that are needed to make millets and sorghum competitive and the technology landscape in Kenya. Also being a member of millet and sorghum innovation system in Kenya he will bring in added expertise in that domain and also help in advocating the reforms needed to improve it.\n\nThe third researcher George Boateng currently a consultant for the African Center for Economic Transformation (ACET) is involved in research that focuses on Agricultural Value chains in Africa. This combined with his background in Rural Development will inure to the benefit of the study.', 'Strengthening Millet and Sorghum Innovation Systems in Kenya: Lessons from Cassava Innovations Systems in Ghana and Nigeria', 'Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria', 'The traditional cereals of millet and sorghum, as the name implies, have long been a key supplier of calories across the African continent. However they have been steadily losing their share of contribution to calories especially to rice and wheat as attested by FAO data. This has fueled huge food imports and at the same time impoverishing those who traditionally grow these crops (as they tend to be grown in marginal areas due to their hardiness). \n\nTraditional cereals have failed to compete effectively with “new” cereals due to weak innovation systems. The traditional cereals innovation system has failed to deliver farm level technologies to improve productivity and quality thus making them uncompetitive. More importantly the innovation system has failed to deliver food products made from these grains that meet demands of new markets that have emerged with urbanization  which demand cheap and convenient foods for the many urban poor and a range of well packaged and shelf-stable foods for a growing middle class. They have remained food produced and consumed by the poor, an image that has also further served to stifle their demand.\n\nYet traditional cereals are more nutritious than foods that are becoming popular. They thrive well in Africa''s  ago-ecological conditions in particular they are drought resistant. At the same time their nutritional value is generally acknowledged and is the key driver of demand of these cereals especially by an emerging health conscious middle class as a recent study by ACET and by ICRISAT has found.  Further the prospect of climate change is calling for building resilience and given the drought resistant nature of the traditional cereals, they deliver resilience in food systems. Indeed in recognition of this, Kenya has prioritized millet and sorghum as it seeks to improve its food security. The motivation is that Kenya is two-thirds semi-arid and arid lands are useful for millet and sorghum production.  A window of opportunity thus exists for traditional cereals to reclaim their position as key staples. \n\nHowever, seizing this opportunities requires building a strong traditional cereals innovation system to develop the products needed to take advantage of the opportunity. The Cassava Innovation systems in Ghana and in Nigeria can provide useful lessons. Cassava has done particularly well in Ghana gaining a significant market share. with many of the technologies employed in Ghana have diffused from Nigeria.\n\nCassava in Nigeria and Ghana has managed to stay competitive and increase its share of food market through a very dynamic innovation system that has managed to deliver innovations at farm level and in the processing sector. At farm level the introduction and uptake of  high yielding Tropical Manioc Selection (TMS) varieties has lowered costs. The uptake of TMS has been greatly facilitated by the rise of an informal but very vibrant cassava processing equipment fabrication sector that hs delivered affordable farm level technologies to poor farmers (note that since cassava must be processed on harvest, supply of labor has traditionally been the limiting factor in uptake of yield improving technologies. In addition the sector has also provided equipment for a largely women owned artisanal food processing sector that has delivered cheap cassava food product with "gari" being the main product This has made cassava food for the urban poor delivering price and convenience attributes. A more formal cassava equipment and food processing sector has managed to make cassava products that meet the demand by the Diaspora and the middle class for shelf-stable well packed varieties of traditional foods. At the center of this has been a public funded research network  of institutions that has developed technologies that have diffused to both the informal and formal equipment and food manufacturers.\n\nTherefore understanding how the cassava innovation systems has worked in Nigeria and Ghana  and how the two systems have complemented each other can help in better understanding how institutional reforms of the traditional grains innovation systems can be reformed and strengthened to deliver the promise of the traditional grains in Kenya. Competitive traditional cereals will not only bring cheap and nutritious products to citizens (especially the growing class of urban poor) but will have a transformative economic impact on the sector, and at the same time on the economically depressed Arid and Semi-Arid lands in Kenya. Transition to traditional grains will better prepare Kenya (and Africa) to better cope with the food insecurity challenges that climate change is poised to unleash.', 'The proposed approach entails 4 phases. Phase 1 will be a desk study, phase 2 is a field study in Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria, phase 3 is a benchmarking and analysis exercise and phase 4 is an advocacy and dissemination phase. The final phase will be Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E).\n\n  Phase 1: Desk study & Development of Data collection instruments\n\nA background study will be done to: (1) better understand the range of technologies and innovations that can make millet and sorghum competitive. These include on-farm production technologies and food manufacturing /processing technologies; (2) High level review of  sorghum and millet innovations systems in Kenya and in Uganda to map actors; (3) Review of Innovation diffusion theories and their application to Sorghum and millet innovation system; (3) high level review of Nigeria and Ghana cassava innovation system to map actors  (3) development of a conceptual framework; (4) Development of data collection instruments and a data collection plan\n\nThis study will draw from sorghum and millet value chain studies we have done in Kenya that have indentified challenges and opportunities across the value chains of these crops.\n \nPhase 2: Case/Field Studies\nField studies will be done in Ghana and Nigeria to map the cassava innovation systems to better understand the institutional arrangements. In particular we will look at:\n-The evolution of the Cassava Innovation Systems\n-The innovation process of the various actors\n-How knowledge diffuses among the actors paying attention to both the formal and informal channels\n-Review of interrelationship between stakeholders including public-private partnerships and how trust is built in the innovation system \n-Review the nature of diffusion channels across the two countries\n-How the innovation systems are funded  \n-Challenges of the cassava Innovation system\n-Opportunities for strengthening the cassava innovation system\n\nThe same exercise will be done for Kenya  millet and sorghum innovation systems.\n\nThe key data collection method applied will be key informants interviews. At least 3 key informants from each group of stakeholders will be selected. The stakeholders include policy makers, government agencies charged with innovation mandate, private sector players (both formal and informal actors). Key attention will be given to informal sector and a focus group discussion will be used to further gather data from this group. \n\nPhase 3: Benchmarking, Analysis and Recommendations  \n\nBenchmarking of Kenya  sorghum and millet innovation systems will be done against Ghana and Nigeria cassava innovations systems to identify gaps and opportunities for improving the sorghum and millet systems.\n\nRecommendations will then be developed based on lessons learned and also from analysis of findings of sorghum and millet innovation studies. Opportunities for collaboration across the country systems using the various regional arrangements in place will be explored.\n\nThe findings will then be validated by stakeholders in the millet and sorghum innovation systems. This will be through a validation workshop. After which policy recommendation will be further refined.\n\nPhase 4: Dissemination and Advocacy\n\nPolicy brief will then be developed and disseminated to various stakeholders paying particular attention to those who can influence policy. The findings will also become resources for the sorghum and millet advocacy platforms being developed as part of work ACET is doing on Sorghum and Millet value chains in Kenya.\n\nUsing the sorghum and millet advocacy platforms, policy recommendation will be shared and advocated as part of events that the advocacy platform plans to hold.\n\nPhase 5: Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E)\n\n(See section on Monitoring and Evaluation)\n\nThe approach used is supportive of ideals of OCSDI in that our methodologies are aimed at facilitating south-south knowledge sharing.', 'The key expected outcome of the exercise is an improved sorghum and millet innovation systems that will develop competitive sorghum and millet value added products that can unlock the value inherent in traditional grains.This will diversify food supply thus improving food security and will also improve incomes of sorghum and millet farmers and thus reduce poverty.\n\nThe exercise will also help understand how lesson in innovation can be transferred and adapted. This project will provide insights into how technological and social innovations interact to make impact.  This will help in adding to the knowledge base of innovations.', 'The ultimate success of well functioning millet and sorghum innovation system is a competitive sector emerging that is able to create value (to farmers and other value chain actors) through a diverse range of products that can address the market needs. Thus presence of a diverse range of millet and sorghum products in the market and improvement in incomes of farmers is thus a good indicator of success. However this is likely to take a few years.  Monitoring can be done in medium term, short term and long term.\n\nIn the short term, clear evidence of improved innovation systems is increase in number of publication and greater collaboration among the actors in innovation systems. This can be measured through publication outputs. Measures will include:\n• Increase in no. of publications on sorghum and millet innovations\n• Increase in number of publications on sorghum and millet innovation that involve different stakeholders e.g. university researcher and private sector  entrepreneurs\n• Increase in number of research publications that build on efforts of others e.g. extension of research on improvement of innovation.\n\nIn the medium to long term, creation of needed entities with proper mandates, development of collaboration agreement between public and private sector, and emergence of private sector dedicated to millet and sorghum innovations: \n• No. of government and research entities with millet and sorghum innovation mandates\n• No. of Sorghum and millet innovation projects running\n• No. of organizations involved in development of sorghum and millet processing equipment\n• The range and capacity of sorghum processing equipment in the market\n• The uptake of processing equipment at farm level\n• Measure of number of sorghum and millet products in the market.\n\nThe Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) exercise will do a quantitative evaluation of short term outcomes and a qualitative evaluation of the longer and medium term impacts through interviews with key informants to see if their outlook and plans for millet and sorghum has changed.', 'Canadian Dollars 77,717', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/Letter_of_support_OCSDNet.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNet_Budget1.xlsx', 173, NULL, 'complete', 'yes', 1410189030, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, 'yes');

Most leading and emerging world economies have invested in science and technology, and have through collaborations between scientists, government, communities and industries, translated the results of scientific endeavours into dividends for public good. It is clear that for science to be meaningful, it must move out of laboratories and academic circles and have impact on the lives of the general populace. It is therefore important that the results of science research be made available and accessible to all stakeholders in national and global development. In recent times, this realization has led to a global push for open access and open science. This movement seeks to remove the barriers to accessing scientific knowledge and has led to the creation of open access journals and open repositories globally including in Nigeria.\nNigeria is one of the more populous African countries with scientific research and innovation being conducted in its many tertiary institutions and research institutes. However, despite the seemingly high volume of scientific research, the results of these are most often are not translated into development initiatives. This is usually because stakeholders are not aware of them. Although there have been activities to promote open access and science in Nigeria in the past, several challenges still remain such as lack of awareness of open access and its significance by stakeholders, lack of supporting infrastructure and manpower, and concerns with plagiarism.\nThe Nigerian Academy of Science is the apex scientific body in Nigeria. The Academy comprising of a Fellowship of leading Nigerian scientists, strives to bring to the attention of stakeholders issues of national relevance. As part of her effort in this, the Academy proposes a project to assess the open access /open collaborative science attitudes and practises of research repositories in Lagos State, Nigeria. Lagos State is home to three tertiary institutions, two colleges of medicine, two libraries, and two research institutes. The project will also involve creating an open access portal for the Academy’s bi-annual journal; The Proceedings of the Nigerian Academy of Science. The specific objectives of the project are to evaluate the knowledge and practice of open science in research repositories in Lagos, assess the existing infrastructure; technical, structural, and political for open science in these institutions, obtain stakeholders recommendation for the success of open science in Nigeria, raise awareness of The Proceedings of the Nigerian Academy of Science, and create an open access portal for this journal.  The project activities will involve an assessment exercise of science repositories in Lagos, a stakeholders’ engagement forum, awareness creation for the Academy journal, and the publication of a project report. It is expected that the project will raise awareness on open science among relevant stakeholders in Lagos State. Also the resulting report will be disseminated as an advocacy tool to stakeholders at the state and national levels.', 'To achieve the specified objectives, the Academy will carry out the following activities: \n1. Assessment of Research repositories: A questionnaire will be designed by a Committee of experts and a consultant to generate information on the state of open science practices in science repositories in Lagos. Two assessment teams will be constituted and trained to assess these institutions during a two day assessment exercise in the state. Key informant interviews and focus group discussions will also be conducted with selected researchers in the institutions.\n2. Stakeholders’ Forum: The findings from the assessment exercise will be analysed and presented to representatives of the visited institutions as well as other relevant stakeholders at a one-day stakeholders’ forum. This will provide an avenue to foster collaboration and formulate a consolidated strategy for the promotion of open science in the state.\n3. Raising awareness/ creation of open access for the Proceedings of the Nigerian Academy of Science: During activities one and two above, stakeholders will be informed of the Academy’s journal. With the expertise of a web administrator, an open access portal for the journal with be created allowing access to articles in the journal. Institutional accounts will be opened for the stakeholders engaged in activity 1 and 2, so as to facilitate their access to the journal.

Since 2009, he has acted as the coordinator of the South African National Grid (SAGrid), engaging the computing divisions of South African universities, research institutes and national laboratories to form an integrated, federated platform e-Science. As part of a four-year international exchange programme funded by the European Commission[^EPIKH] , the human capacity of the initiative was strengthened, and expanded to support new users and applications. During this period, strong links were built between the participants from other regions, particularly north-African countries. Concurrently, he acted as technical advisor to the HP and UNESCO-funded [Brain Gain Initiative](http://www.unesco.com/brain-gain). This project lasted from 2009 to 2013, and included more than 20 institutes in Africa and the Middle East. The participants of this project formed the core of what would become the AfricaGrid Initiative, consolidated in what is now the Africa-Arabia Regional Operations Centre (AAROC).\n\nWorking closely with the Ubuntunet Alliance regional NREN, Dr. Becker represented the Sub-Saharan region in the [CHAIN](http://www.chain-project.eu/old-project) project (2010-2012) and subsequent [CHAIN-REDS](http://www.chain-project.eu) project.

The advent of the internet era has of course brought great potential to those who have been able to exploit it. The differentiator is often understood to be *access* to services and resources, however this is only true in the case where the user community is actually empowered to take advantage of these services in the way that they deem fit. Often, access to these services has been provided either by large corporations with little interest in advancing the interest of the end-user, or by large public institutions which do remain focussed on flagship projects of limited scope or impact. What truly differentiates those who have from those who have not is the *ability to exploit* access to services and resources. We will argue that this ability comes in the form a fairly new kind of professional: the *transversal expert*.  We argue that it is access to **this** resource - the expert at the boundary between the science and the services - that differentiates performance in e-Science. \n\nSuccess in research - the ability to produce outputs that have impact, as well as the ability to ensure sustained development - depends on agility, access, specialisation, and reward systems, amongst others. These imply a series of ***support structures***  which researchers rely on in order to focus on producing these outputs and sustaining their community. Often, it is still assumed that these support structures need to be developed and maintained within the community itself. They include things like computational resources, data storage and sharing services, collaborative tools for software development and scholarly communication, etc etc.\n\nGiven the crucial nature of e-Infrastructure in almost all aspects of modern research, a significant amount of overhead in research collaborations goes into the acquisition and maintenance of computational and data resources. This resulted in a special kind of scientist - the technical expert. These were "normal" researchers who out of necessity became very well-versed in the technology required by their community, and developed methodologies for providing these as services. This created a so-called "third career" for researchers, who up to then were either theoretical or experimental. This researcher, with extremely sought-after skills and transversal mobility, was however invisible, since traditional academic metrics did not take into account their contributions. This invisibility severely hampers the sustainability of the entire research programme, and constrains these catalytic roles to silos, within their particular research group.\n\nIt is an empirical fact that these enablers exist and can be found in almost any research environment or institute on the continent. Our proposal aims at analysing and understanding how these crucial people work in Africa, in three specific contexts - South Africa, Kenya and Tanzania. Although we pose this project primarily within Theme 2 (Infrastructure and Technologies), we aim to address at least three of the themes of OCSDNet directly, by posing and studying the responses to the following questions : \n\n  * Theme 1 - motivations (incentives and ideologies)\n     * What incentives are presented to the transversal expert in terms of career advancement or other rewards ?\n     * Is openness encouraged in terms of access and support ? Where do the limitations of this openness arise ? \n     * To what extent do institutes recognise the transversal expert and their contribution to an ecosystem beyond the boundaries of that institute  ?\n  * Theme 2 - Infrastructures & Technologies: \n     * How do the services offered by the ROC map onto those needed by researchers in the region ? \n     * What are the gaps that exist between the technologies supported and developed by the ROC ?\n  * Theme 3 - Communities of practice in open and collaborative science:\n     * What conditions are necessary for the emergence of the transversal expert ? \n     * To what extent does Open Science influence the development of the transversal expert ? Is it  a necessary condition, or vice-versa ?\n\nTheme 4  "Potential impacts (positive and negative) of open and collaborative science" will not be addressed directly in this proposal, but rather indirectly, by studying certain use cases as described in the Design and Methodologies below.', 'The project envisions two communities of practice involved : \n  * Research communities themselves, either established or emerging, in a particular domain of science\n  * "transversal experts", which by definition have no domain, but (we propose) provide support across the boundaries of institute and scientific domain.\n  \nThe project will undertake two streams of activity involving each of these communities directly, with a third which will aim at interpreting the interaction between them: \n\n 1. Work Package 1 - case studies for demonstrating impact of access to transversal experts and associated infrastructure on the research of specific groups\n 2. Work Package 2 - situational analysis of the environment that the transveral expert\n 3. Work Package 3 - continual feedback surveys from researchers involved to document changes in perception of the Open Collaborative Science environment.\n\nThese will be done in the following phases : \n\nPhase 1 - preparation\n\nThere will be an initial period of consolidation and preparation, undertaken by the project partners, to prepare both the "transverse experts" for their upcoming role in the project, as well as identify specific research use cases. An initial workshop will be held within 4 months of the start, to put the research and technical communities in the same room. The role of the project will be to allow each to express their goals in a common language, and to provide input regarding available resources and infrastructure in the ROC. A baseline study will be undertaken during the preparation phase and published at the first workshop. Research communities initially proposed are in the climate, astronomy and bioinformatics domain, since we have initial contact with these, but are by no means limited to them. Feasibility will be evaluated during the course of the preparation phase.\n\nPhase 2 - exploration\n\nDuring phase 2, the research communities will separately undertake their research activities, almost "unperturbed", while a strong coordination effort will be undertaken by the project in the community of the transversal experts. The project will collect their experience, frustrations, successes and requirements, and provide support where possible, and coordinating support with peer infrastructures such as EGI where possible. Durig this phase, the effort will be made to ensure that the transversal expert''s contribution becomes visible : \n  \n  * Stories from the community will be published by the project\n  * Analysis of the situation will be undertaken and published\n  * where possible, the research communities will be encouraged to consider the technical experts as co-authors of their scholarly outputs, particularly regarding "grey literature"\n\nPhase 3 - consolidation and retrospection\n\nAt the end of the second phase, we expect certain narratives to emerge. These are not expected to be entirely positive, and particular effort will be made to explore the "failures" of the model in an unbiased way. However, certain success stories are expected. A workshop involvig the original teams will again be convened, to discuss these experiences and in particular reflect on the perceptions of the transversal expert by researchers, themselves and their employers. From the previously-conducted gap analysis, we hope to show that certain needs of the research have been fulfilled by the transversal expert, and the infrastructure services of the ROC, while highlighting the needs to make the contribution of the transversal expert explicitly visible.', 'We expect two broad categories of outcomes :\n  \n  * Better understanding of what the transveral expert is - \n     * what is their role in African research institutes ?\n     * what hinders them ? (perhaps the same factors which hinder open, collaborative science ?)\n  * Better awareness \n     * an awareness at the institutional level of the need and nature of these roles\n     * a self-awareness of people who may initially not consider themselves "experts"\n   \nSome emphasis will be placed on evaluating the impact of gender in these roles.\n\nIt is expected in some cases that the Regional Operations Centre can act as a "centre of gravity" - a "home without borders" for the transversal expert. The re-organisation (or merely organisation) of many individuals into a more coherent system, we propose, will have significant impact not only on the development of the communities which they support, but on their own technical community, thanks to the positive feedback mechanism that the ROC affords.', 'Monitoring of the outcomes of the project will be done continuously during second two phases of the project. A quarterly survey will be undertaken by Michelle Willmers of the University of Cape Town, as project co-researcher.\n\nSubjective evaluation on the role of the transversal expert will be undertaken by \n\n  * the research communities involved\n  * the directors or leaders of the institutes which the experts come from\n\nThis will be undertaken at the three phases of the project, and reported back to each stakeholder at the joint workshops.\n\nAs the purpose of the project is to highlight the role and visibility of the transversal expert, effort will made for these individuals to create some visbility online, by\n  \n  * contribution software and other tools to shared software repositories on e.g. Github\n  * publishing their contributions to the research process, including in "grey-literature" form, via e.g. slideshare and figshare\n  \nAltmetrics tools such as ImpactStory will be used to provide an alternative narrative on the contribution of the transversal expert, and\n\nFurthermore, the relevant of the Regional Operations Centre as a "home" for the transversal expert will be evaluated. \n\nSimple quantitative metrics proposed are :\n  \n  * How many transversal experts have discoverable online personas at the start compared to the end of the project\n  * How many research outputs of various kinds are being published by individuals compared to collaborations at the start, compared to the end of the project ? \n\nIt is to be understood that qualitative metrics will be important during the course of the project, but should be developed in concert with the research and technical communities.', '80000', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/EGIeu_LoS_AAROC1.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/AAROC_OCSD_Net_Budget1.fods', 23, 255, 'complete', 'yes', 1411250521, 'complete', 'This application has at its heart an interesting question but it is phrased with great vagueness, particularly around what will actually be done.

Particularly, these benefits are more useful to communities of researchers especially in institutions of higher learning. This is because, such institutions are looked upon to come up with tangible research work that will contribute to advancements and improvements in their specific fields of practice. The Kenya Universities Act (2012), states that one of the objectives of a university is the advancement of knowledge through teaching, scholarly research and scientific investigation.  Another objective is the promotion of highest standards in quality of teaching and research.  Another critical objective is the dissemination of the outcomes of the research conducted by the university to the general community. Institutions of higher learning comprise of Universities, Colleges, as well as vocational or training schools. However, more often than not, the research that comes from these institutions remains unused and inaccessible due to various reasons. Some of the reasons are such as copyright issues. People are aware that they need to copyright their work. However, lack of knowledge with regards to how to ensure their material is copyrighted could be a factor that pulls them back to put their work out there. The fear of plagiarism is also a cause for lack publishing their work. This still happens despite the fact that there are tools that have been developed to counter such problems such as Turnitin. Researchers may pull back from publishing their work due to the perception that their intellectual property rights will be infringed. One may claim that he or she owns a job that was done by the researcher.  This may in the end act as a hindrance to development in the researcher’s specific areas of study. \nThis research aims to study the current research practices in Kenyan Universities and research hubs, identify the loopholes in Open and Collaborative practices and suggest ways on how to form open and collaborative networks for the development of the nation.\nData collection and gathering through the use of desktop research, focus groups and interviews will be used to determine the limitations of having Open and Collaborative networks amongst higher learning institutions. It will also be used to find out the constraints of having open access to data, and also the challenges experienced while putting their data out there.\n\nOne of the ways suggested to promote open collaboration is through the formation of knowledge sharing consortiums amongst Kenyan institutions of higher learning and research hubs whereby researchers can work together on a certain idea. \nAnother way could be to come up with a central digital warehouse for all kinds of institutions’ research works. With this kind of a central place to get information, researchers can build upon the works of other researchers in order to avoid duplication of work. In this way, research produced by institutions of higher education will be very easily accessible and of very high quality. \nThe following are the objectives of the study.\nProject Objectives\nTo determine the benefits of pen Collaborative initiative for the Kenya researchers’ community.\nTo identify ways in which Kenya researchers can work together in order to form a central pool of research knowledge base.\nTo identify and implement a suitable model for knowledge creation and sharing among researchers.\nTo test the viability of the developed model. \nTo foster enabling networks for adoption and management of Open Collaboration among Kenyan researchers.\nResearch questions\nWhat are the benefits of Open and Collaborative networks among researchers in the Kenyan communities?\nWhat are the various ways in which researchers in Kenya can work together to come up with development solutions in their specific fields of study?\nHow can a model for knowledge creation and sharing be implemented?\nHow viable is the developed knowledge sharing model?\nHow can research networks be established to ensure continuity in open collaboration for research works?', 'The project will kick start with a plan that will capture project objectives and deliverables, project timelines, project structure and governance, rules of engagement and assumptions. Stakeholders who will be involved in the project will also be identified at this stage.\nTools for data collection will be developed. A comprehensive desktop research, interviews and surveys with key stakeholders ranging from the private research centers/hubs or institutions to government agencies in order to gather relevant information around the Open Collaboration practice in Kenya. Findings will be analyzed and an inception report will be prepared to serve as a guide during the next phase of discussions.\nA diverse committee comprising of experts in intellectual property rights, research and publication procedures, Universities management and open collaborative science advocators will engage in dialogues to deliberate on the challenges that hinder the adoption of open collaboration and how to promote exchange of knowledge among researchers in an effort to facilitate innovation in Kenya.  \nThe outcome of the dialogue will lead to the formulation of policies favorable to the open collaboration initiative and the development of a model for knowledge sharing. The developed model will be implemented across research communities and tested for feasibility. Upon successful results, an awareness campaign will be done in form of a workshop or press conference. Results will also be presented in various events and submitted for publication in a journal or blog or magazine.\nIn order to ensure successful and qualitative delivery of the project, the project team will develop a monitoring and evaluation plan that will include meeting reviews, project monitoring, quality management, risk management, scope change management, communication, stakeholder management and status reporting among others.\nA project report will be prepared for stakeholders and the public.', 'Without quality research, it will be very difficult and almost impossible for Kenya to achieve its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) or even it’s Vision 2030. The pillars that are key to achieving Vision 2030 are Tourism, agriculture, manufacturing, I.T. enabled services, wholesale and retail trade as well as financial services. For all of these to be implemented, it will mean that the stakeholders in these sectors collaborate and come up with better solutions for all the problems in these sectors. The only way to be successful to achieve our national goals is when the relationship between research and innovation is fully developed. In Kenya, universities have been placed as key leaders of research.\nWith the proposed model, research data from universities that is collected to a central repository will mean that access is much easier for anyone who needs any kind of information. \nInnovations in different fields will be voluminous. For example, researchers from the agricultural sector can rely on information from previous studies in order to come up with a better cross breed of a seed, or even a better breed of a domestic animal. This may in turn improve the agricultural sector in leaps and bounds. Agriculture is a major revenue generator for Kenya.\nPolicy makers from the government sector and other institutions can also use this information to help them make better and more informed decisions that rely on studies that have previously been conducted.\nIn the medical sector, stakeholders in this field will have a better understanding of the medical conditions or even better methods of delivering health services. For example, researchers in this field can build up on each other’s work in finding the cure of ailments such as Ebola which is now an international menace.\nAn interdisciplinary mix of scholars from different fields of study can also join hands and discover new knowledge and insights which can lead to whole new fields of application. A whole range of new products and services are developed, that would benefit the society.\nInformation technology can also be applied to various fields in the industrial sector with the purpose of improvement of delivery of goods and services. For example new technology practices may have been discovered in the field of agriculture and health. However, the current scenario is such that some discoveries are lying somewhere in a library and may not be accessed in a long period of time. The new knowledge discovered may be used and built up on to produce more credible and better findings.\nJobs will also be generated from research. Partnerships are established from the business world, and the research practices are applied to business projects. This in turn attracts related investments which lead to startup companies that are as a result of the research.\nHaving a network of local university research peers and networks is a good starting point towards building a Kenya with a strong economy and a country that has a good foundation towards the realization of its Vision 2030.', 'The monitoring and evaluation plan includes:\n\n• Meeting Reviews\n\nThis section defines the types of review meetings and reporting to be undertaken to ensure the project remains on track.

So far, the data collections that are made are limited to photographs and are not processed for further use. Furthermore those data collection are not significant in quantity in digital form and rarely available online.\n\nThe research strives to digitize, experiment and provide widespread access to Ethiopian architectural and construction history, as well as design and technology in order to induce the development and growth of local economy and cultural trends. The research is to be conducted at the EiABC in collaboration with iceaddis EiABC.\n\nThe idea of identity, character and context in design, architecture, construction and contextual economy of a country or a society can be a very complicated endeavour. One cannot understand these phenomenons by simply stumbling particularly on the past, present or future. If the designer wants to make use of these entities in his or her design endeavors, the designer will have to look in to all the three time frames.\n?If a design is conceived only out of a mere understanding of material, geometry and utility, it can only be a universal truth without context, identity or character. Material and geometry are merely tools for the designer to express needs or culture of the people the design is made for. The designers are also being more and more exposed to the complex nature of their design tools through technology. Now more than ever designers are being able to access geometries and mechanisms they used to not.\nIn industrialized countries, different software tools have been developed according to their trends in  methods and technology. As a result the software are equipped with the relative countries’ culture and construction details and furniture, landscape and texture libraries. It is only reasonable that most design and construction solutions we see today are expressed through these elements and are generic. Ultimately making it difficult for the developing countries to see their development precisely and specific to their identity, culture, and corresponding needs.\n\nIt is up to the designer to control the design work outcome, but almost all design presentations and constructed building details are dominated by the contents of the software being used. For instance, the designer is influenced by the available libraries for door and window types, furniture and construction details. As mentioned above, almost all software available are equipped with libraries and other design elements and trends containing mostly industrialized cultures.\n\nThe provision of Ethiopian/African design tools in digital media, ground, in a parametric will encourage local and international designers to consider the potentials of the local techniques and challenge these attributes to represent the future. This scenario will ultimately affect the design and construction industry of the country both locally and internationally.\n\nFor very long time different institutes of architecture, construction and engineering have been trying to encourage Ethiopian/African designers and builders to consider Ethiopian building construction techniques in order to make the evolvement and development of the local builders and industries apparent.\n\nBy making these elements available to professionals worldwide and, more specifically, to emerging Ethiopian/African professionals in precise and practical ways, we will assist in advancing the Ethiopian industry of architecture and construction as a result induces context based industry economy for Ethiopia/Africa. The research looks in to and builds on exiting related literature with partial or similar concern.\n\nWe believe that if we make the building typologies, furniture designs, construction details, etc. easily accessible by providing software plug-in equipped with the necessary elements, we can encourage local as well as international designers to come up with Ethiopian/ African designs, construction and architecture solution, further more to transform the traditional way of design through manipulation of the elements the research entails.\n\nThe results of this research will have a significant impact on Ethiopian/African architecture. Local institutes of design, construction and engineering have been trying for many years to encourage designers and builders to consider Ethiopian building construction techniques on their works.\nThis research provides them with the software required to quickly and efficiently access traditional techniques, providing a further incentive to use them in their work. The research outputs will prove to be easily accessible and informative to the users and are to be provided to a large network of users through open source. Online libraries will be sourced through a network of interested research groups and provide users with full access to the permanently growing outputs.', 'Students in institutes such as EiABC and professionals make it their responsibility to experiment and learn different software tools formally and informally in order to implement their ideas. Through these software tools, the research intends to can access these students and professionals through exposing them to different elements of consideration: Ethiopian/ African style architecture, construction details, furniture, texture, ornaments, patterns and building typologies. There by promoting and developing Ethiopian/ African style architecture design components. Ultimately inducing the growth and development of these countries’ local economy and industry. \n\nIn Ethiopia/Africa, schools, offices and different organizations use different software tools for various purposes such as: facilitate teaching and learning process, design and document projects. EiABC is one of the organizations that uses software for teaching, design and documentation. The software under consideration can be design and construction software such as Revit, AutoCAD, 3ds Max and Rhinoceros.  \n\nBy interpreting trends from the cultural heritage, the recent developments and the projection of future, design in sense of the research is an open transformation process that creates a connection between those particular ages and methods. Through the process of documentation the research adds the most important factor to the design process, which is capacity of transformability through comparable parameters and making them accessible to the vast users and which are: architects, designers, engineers, artists, educators, students and interested persons.  \n\nThe data collection includes:\nmodels of Ethiopian construction material details, furniture and utensils, Ethiopian house design types and indigenous plants (including a selection of trees and landscape elements).\ntwo-dimensional and high quality pictures of Ethiopian construction material textures, construction technique patterns and background images.\ndesign and construction principles that are built through workshop and research activities.\narticles, journals and literature.\n\nThe collected date will be parameterized so that users can have the capacity to transform them towards their design goals and meet the economic needs of the community they are in. The research also covers the already transformed details accomplished by different architects and engineers.\n\nThe provision of data through a digital open library gives access to the interested persons and encourages a wider catchment through network of interested groups and organizations to grow the data stock.\n\nThe research needs database that will always grow and develop. In fulfilling of this objective the research is to be supplemented by class exercises/academic practices every year at the institute, EiABC, and other related universities around the country and the continent.\n\nThere are series of workshops being conducted at the institute, EiABC, on the research objectives.  By expanding the frequency of the workshops it is possible to get sustainable input for the research and create principles that would identify the Ethiopian heritages and shape them to develop and flourish in all digital aspects to secure the future growth and development of the country’s culture and economy as digital media is becoming the standard and favorite media for designers worldwide. \n\nThe transfer of traditional design towards the future or current trend of industry and economy of the country/ the African continent can mostly be done with the traditional crafts. This crafts are still surviving through the limited ground they are provided with. The research includes the work with crafts men to see the exchange of knowledge and opportunities between the academic system, the crafts people and industry. \n\nFurthermore the research will lookout for international opportunities to incorporate universities in African countries to conduct the similar project. Creating and incorporating a larger trend (to have the same trend outside Ethiopia as well) with counties in Africa having the same concern will insure the objective of the research to be realized. The research also looks out for other international beneficiaries to take part by conducting workshops and initiating mobility among research groups.', 'With the creation of a database that is specific to Ethiopian context, the research focusses on the production of academic and non-academic modules, that allow the reproduction in different contexts. By implementation of the results from data collection and data preparation in academic context, different methodologies can be described from practical their application:\n\nThe research uses data collection from site. Collected data will be made through strategy of research objective these collected data will be processed for further use for the research and will also be shared along interested groups in an open source.\nThe research digitizes the old or past heritages of the country and uses the document for further use for the research and also share the document along interested groups in an open source method. (module 1)\n The research digitizes the current trend of professionals and crafts men of the country and uses the document for further use for the research and also share the document along interested groups in an open source method. (module 2)\nThe research also experiments on the above two modules and comes up design principles and trends. The above experiments will provide solutions for different design components of architecture and construction endeavors. The research will digitizes these solutions and uses the document for further use for the research and also share the document along interested groups in an open source method. (module 3)\nThe research will also undergo module production phase where prototypes are made through the provided current manufacturing technology and available skills. The prototypes are used as proving entities the experiments of the research and also teaching method among different groups of the research. \nPublications, academic modules, workshops and exhibitions, setting up centers and opportunities for different personal.  \nThe project strives to research and build principles and methods on how to manufacture the heritages in the currently developing technology. As a result the research wants to identify and exploit the potential of CNC-technology to manufacture the local traditional crafts and cultural heritages through the machines. Here methods are developed to design and digitize the heritages for the readily availability of Ethiopian culture to develop through the technology to flourish towards the future. The process will be considering a proper design process.', 'The data collection system will be developed in the first quartile and tested with students in the second quartile of the first year.\n- Data is collected from different areas of the country. The data collection system takes specifically into consideration the geographic location of the heritages locations. By taking in to consideration the size of the available data, an entire countries heritage, the research intents to build a network of universities in the country.\n\nQuantitative of collected data will exceed 50 items within the first two quartiles of the first year and a minimum of 100 students will be educated in the method of data collection after two years.\n- The quality of the collected data is seen through a set of rules given to the data collecting team. As the data to be collected are various in size are shape and condition different modules and methods are set. Solutions are provided to the data collection and processing body after analysis of the conditions of the data we will work with.\n\nWithin the third and fourth quartile of the first year, two exemplary workshops will be conducted and evaluated on the impact of data provision.\n\nThrough the first and second quartile of the second year an online library is launched and accessible for public.\n\nIn the third and fourth quartile of the second year, first academic modules will be implemented in the institute’s teaching activities:\n- The module production or prototype production phase is managed through provision of method of softcopy preparation of the design and description of method of production. Design process, knowledge transformation among different groups of the research, production drawing (cad files), and finally machine tool paths and crafts orientation.\n\nThe final phase in third and fourth quartile of the second year is applied for plug-in programming and software building.\n- The collected data will be transformed in to plugin that are to be supplementary to different software.

From meditation to economic analysis, Open Data and Collaborative processes, data collection, and public policy experience – our team will be able to engage communities in this ambitious process that piggy-backs on an existing crowdsourced initiative. This research will put forward important information in potential group engagement (Open Decision Making process) and Collaborative participation. \n\nThe three principal researchers bring together opportunity to innovate in countries affected by conflict.', 'Analysis for a (Pre) Post-conflict Strategy in Colombia', 'Colombia', 'There are the only 11 countries in the world that are actually free from conflict reported the Institute for Economics and Peace. It may make for dreary reading, but of the 162 countries covered by the yearly study from the Institute for Economics and Peace’s (IEP’s), just 11 were not involved in conflict of one kind or another. Worse still, the world as a whole has been getting incrementally less peaceful every year since 2007 – sharply bucking a trend that had seen a global move away from conflict since the end of the Second World War.\n\nPost-conflict strategies are never made public before a Peace Accord is signed. Researches during conflict focuses on factors that have contributed to the conflict and researches during post-conflict focuses on the gaps or needs. Victims and the population at large normally awaits for a signed accord before putting in place the processes that would eventually help prevent further conflict as well as address all areas of trust and transparency in the process.  It is widely agreed that local ownership and transparency are some of the fundamental principles of successful Security Sector Reform (SSR) programmes (Donais 2009; OECD 2007; Oosterveld and Galand 2012; Mobekk 2010) but the local population is rarely involved in the process. Nonetheless, there is a gap between policy and practice, which this proposed research would investigate in respect of SSR programmes in post-conflict environments. The reasons that are often stated for the reluctance to promote local ownership will be analysed, particularly in light of general acceptance that lack of local ownership will result in institutions and processes that do not enjoy popular support and are, thus, likely to be unsustainable. For example would it be possible to engage the population in a (pre) post-conflict strategy that would address trust and transparency?\n\nSuch reluctance to promote local ownership can be attributed to limited capacity and lack of expertise; time and cost constraints; access to information about local actors, the ability to demonstrate quantifiable results and quick wins; and an awareness that other principles inherent to SSR may be jeopardised if local actors do not agree with them. \n\nThe objectives of this study are to investigate how Open Science and Adversarial Collaboration could lend itself as an important process for a (pre) post-conflict strategy. In a world with more conflict, can focused research on allocation of resources before a post-conflict help in rapid response that engages local communities in the process. This research would provide great insight in ways researchers would look at processes that could be implemented during a conflict. All conflict eventually lead to a “peace accord” but as mentioned in the background part of this document, the implementation of a peace accord is greatly affected by its ability to engage the local population/organizations.\n\nThe research will touch on the rational, passionate, and cultural thinking that can affect Open and Collaborative decision making when it comes to limited financial resources – in this case preparing for a post-conflict. Before Kahneman and Tversky, people who thought about social problems and human behavior tended to assume that we are mostly rational agents. They assumed that people have control over the most important parts of their own thinking. They assumed that people are basically sensible utility-maximizers and that when they depart from reason. They proved that actual human behavior often deviates from the old models and that the flaws are not just in the passions but in the machinery of cognition. They demonstrated that people rely on unconscious biases and rules of thumb to navigate the world, for good and ill.\n\nPost-conflict situation lack information and the allocation of resources (financial and human) is left to government and international organizations. In this Open Science experiment, we will use different information structures to engage local organizations in the decision process to “map” needs and opportunities. With limited resources to distribute, communities and organizations will be engaged in the mapping exercise as well as making decisions on how resources would be allocated.\n\nThe research team has already developed clear research questions \nPremise 1. Various information structures can be appropriated.\nPremise 2. Social rules guide the type of information structure appropriation.\nPremise 3. A group’s internal social system influences appropriation.\nPremise 4. Appropriation during decision phases influences dynamics of decision (social) interaction\nPremise 5. Emergent structures influence the dynamics of the decision process.\nPremise 6. Appropriation and phasing during decision process influences decision outcomes\nPremise 7. Initial conditions and decision processes influence reproduction of social structures.', 'The purpose of this study is twofold: a) to investigate the opportunities that lie in having in place a process that would foster an Open and Collaborative approach to prepare for an eventual post-conflict situation hence (Pre) Post-Conflict strategy. This study will take a close look at the factors that would contribute to an Open and Collaborative space in research and participation: b) to investigate the human factors that can be associated in decision making around mapping and allocation of financial resources.\n\nThe terminology used in the proposed study are also crucial where one word could make a great difference in the approach of the research as well as the outcome. For example collaboration is define as working with others to do a task and to achieve shared goals. It is a recursive process where two or more or organizations work together to realize shared goals. Cooperation might be a “softer” approach than collaboration where cooperation means working with someone in the sense of enabling: making them more able to do something (typically by providing information or resources they wouldn''t otherwise have).\n\nOn the other hand, an approach that facilitates open and adversarial collaboration  might be more appropriate in the context of a conflict situation. Adversarial Collaboration is known as a scientific experiment conducted by two groups (or more) of experimenters with competing hypotheses, with the aim of constructing and implementing an experimental design in a way that satisfies both groups that there are no obvious biases or weaknesses in the experimental design.\n\nThe proposed methodology will piggy-back on an initiative that is being discussed in Colombia where all of the stakeholders have accepted the need for a (pre) post conflict strategy.  The proposed strategy in built on “issues” that have been stated above about the need to eventually engage locals in the post conflict. The problems lies in the lack of information about who the locals are, what are their capacity to deliver on specific needs or opportunities, the lack of agreed standard or methodology on the collection of data in order to measure impact, etc.\n\nIn the context of the four suggested theme, we have seriously considered each one of them separately but eventually opted to include all of them. Obviously the initial focus will be on Infrastructures and Technologies but the process will lead researchers and participants to address Theme 3 and 4. We would use an adversarial collaboration approach as part of the research so that participating groups / individuals with competing hypotheses would agree on the construction of an experimental design in ways that would satisfies all groups that there are no obvious biases or weaknesses in the experimental design.\n\nWe chose to relate to the subject with as much openness and inquisitiveness as possible without formulating any clear theses until we are in contact with the field. We believe that qualitative methodology is best suited to such our approach. In this way, we hoped to capture, as far as possible, the themes that are important to researchers, the community, and stakeholders that we will interview, and about whom this study is based, rather than focusing upon subjects influenced by our own theoretical observations as to what would be relevant. However, such an approach does place great demands of openness on us as researchers. Ideally, one should be open and objective to all the factors one comes across and treat all subject matter with the same degree of interest and understanding.\n\nThe proposed methodology will address research questions about the socio-behavioral dynamics of geographic information system &#40;GIS&#41; use during open and collaborative decision making in small inter-organizational groups that are still in situation of armed-conflicts. Using an experimental design of a conference room setting, a study of human-computer-human interaction will be conducted with groups of volunteer participants formed into sub-groups, each group representing multiple organizational stakeholder perspectives.\n\nParticipants/volunteers will be selected from a list of various stakeholders present in the different communities.  In order to quickly undertake the research and to implement the methodology, we have already have secured the participation/collaboration from the following networks and universities.\n\n- Community leaders\n- Five regions of Colombia have already accepted to participate in this process (Valle del Cauca, Putumayo, Cauca, Nariño, El Choco)\n- National Governments agencies such as ANSPE, DPS (existing mapping)\n- Two universities – Javeriana / Cooperativa\n- Federation of NGOs in Colombia http://ccong.org.co/ccong/ \n- Groups engaged in Peace discussion\n \nThe research will take place over 12 months in five regions of Colombia that are the most affected by the armed conflict.', 'Our research will help fill a gap in knowledge about group use of geographic information systems applied to value-laden, public-private problems for communities in situation of conflict. The question of testing differences in information use versus software use often arises. To address this concern, we will opt for  “classic” project selection preference problem that deal with emerging concern about aid allocation in the context of community-government debates. The geographic information that will be collected during the experiment will be adopted from the realistic aid allocation decision task that normally take place after a peace accord is signed. The information will be conveyed to participants through somewhat common map and decision table information structures (Nyerges1991), and those information structures will be implemented in GIS software. We will narrow the information structures to those two to be able to address differences in the classic “tables” and “maps” concern: which is better for what activity? The information structures are general enough in nature that any GIS could implement them. Thus, we believe our findings will address differences in information use as much as differences in software use, the two being intimately connected.\n\nThe findings will broaden and deepen our understanding of the conceptual underpinnings of GIS-supported collaborative decision making by way of empirical analysis linked to a theoretical base. Examining the premises and their respective hypotheses will provide a way of systematically addressing research questions and subsequent hypotheses about the dynamics of geographic information (system) use in groups (more specifically in conflict situation). Addressing research questions using an experimental design will provide a foundation for examining details about decision process dynamics involving geographic decision aids.\n\nThe existing research literature encourages us to focus on decision process rather than decision outcomes. Researchers working on decision support topics in the management sciences suggest that process-based research is more meaningful than outcomes-based research in a laboratory setting, since the latter fosters little ownership of results (Rohrbaugh 1989; Todd 1995). From a case study perspective, Yin (1994) recommends a process-based approach for research contexts, even for field studies, and an outcomes-based approach for program evaluation contexts. Because outcomes in public (group) problems are often difficult to predict, Renn, Webler and Wiedemann (1995) and Wood and Gray (1991) also recommend process-oriented research.\n\nWhile believing that cooperation is the most efficient form of social behavior (e.g., Nowak et al., 2000), collaborative decision-making (CDM) to solve problems is an aspect of human behavior least yielding to rational predictions. \n\nWith increasing conflicts around the world caused by limited resources and lack of opportunities, this research will address an important gap in public policies around strategies that could be implemented before a Peace Accord. Using Open and Collaborative science would offer opportunities to engage researchers and communities at large through methodologies that foster “adversarial collaboration”. This research will bring important for policy makers on the impact of financing for development in Middle Income Countries in the context of the Post-2015 agenda.', 'Progress against indicators will be monitored regularly by the Research Coordinator (Luc Lapointe). While project progress against timelines will be tracked every months, overall project effectiveness will be assessed on a 2 monthly basis.\n\nOur groups maintains a set of broad principles when addressing monitoring and evaluation (Participation, Negotiation, Learning, and Flexibility).\n\nMuch of the information required during the project cycle will come through the various templates to be used by researchers throughout implementation of the project. During implementation, emphasis is on key questions around the issues of project rationale and project effectiveness. Our aim in requiring periodic reporting on project performance throughout implementation is to continually check these as against the four following pillars: Continued Project Rationale, Project Efficiency, Project Effectiveness (Impact), Lessons Learned.\n\nAll measurements taken during the course of the project will be stored electronically during the interviews and participants gathering. Measurements and other project information will be collated as described in the plan and collated for progress and regular reporting. Results will be presented to the coordinating group and any other project participants using local reporters and technology when possible. As well as allowing identification and implementation of any improvements to the project, project participants can reflect on and acknowledge the achievements made. \n\nWe may make additional measurements and compare them with the baseline measures we take before the project starts. These will be recorded and we can discuss any changes in what we are doing should occur to achieve our goal. \n\nAt project completion, the Research Coordinator will:\n\n- Collate all information in the final report to be submitted to the funder\n- Determine the effectiveness of the project in meeting project objectives and achieving project outcomes and\n- Determine the appropriateness of the project activities and project approach to achieving objectives\n\nWe will have small workshops of core participants and guide them through a process to evaluate how the project had gone, present them with the information we have collected and ask them for their feedback. We will also ask residents what they think of the process and outcomes using a short survey form. \n\nThe project participants will hold a small event to acknowledge the completion of the project, and promote the works to the local community.

That project was successfully completed and we are completing the preparation of the final report to the funding organization, (the WHO). It is our belief that this Principal Researcher  has the requisite skills, expertise and experience to successfully complete this proposed project.', 'Strenghtening Implementation of the National Injection Safety and Healthcare Waste Management Policy among Healthcare workers in Nigeria', 'Nigeria', 'Abstract\nIntroduction\nInjection safety is defined by WHO as an injection that is administered using appropriate equipment, does no harm to the recipient, does not expose the provider to any avoidable risk and does not result in any waste that is dangerous to other people. A cross country survey showed that unsafe injection practice among health workers is high in developing countries with prevalence rate of as high as 80% in Nigeria. Health workers, patients and communities are exposed to unnecessary risk from unsafe injection practices and improper health care waste management. This takes heavy toll on both the human and material resources of the national economy and national development. There is thus need to contain the menace of unsafe injection and poor healthcare waste management in order to develop quality and safer healthcare and conserve national gross domestic product.\nExtent of the problem:\nThe WHO estimates that over 16 billion injections are given annually in developing and transitional countries. Hospitalized patients, including those infected with HIV are exposed to 10 to 100 times as many injections. It was shown that between 70% and 99% of these injections are unnecessary and over 50% of them are given in unsafe manner. Globally, unsafe injection was responsible for an estimated 21 million cases of HBV infection, 2 million cases of HCV infection, and 260,000 cases of HIV infection in the year 2000 alone. Estimates show that 9.18 million disability life adjusted years (DALYs) would be lost between the years 2000 and 2030 due to unsafe injection and poor healthcare waste management. Each year, the annual global burden of indirect medical cost due to HBV, HCV, and HIV/AIDS is estimated to be US$535 million. The WHO further estimated that over 501,000 deaths have occurred because of unsafe injection practices. These deaths could have been prevented through safe injection practices which include reduction of injections, compliance to safe injection practices and adequate healthcare waste management system. There is, therefore, need to strengthen injection safety practices and healthcare waste management among healthcare workers in Nigeria in order to curtail the menace of unsafe injections and poor healthcare waste management. \nBackground and Rationale\nIn developing countries such as Nigeria injection safety practices and proper health care waste management (HCWM) has not received adequate attention it deserves. Unsafe injection practices abound and hazardous and toxic wastes are put into dump facilities with few safeguards, if any, to protect the environment. Interventions by international donor agencies in Nigeria to combat infectious diseases have led to increased health services uptake with concomitant increase in injections and quantities of healthcare wastes. This has lead to a greater-than-ever need to strengthen safer injection practices and appropriate healthcare wastes management systems. Most injection safety and healthcare wastes management studies in Nigeria documented a poor implementation of the 2007 National Policy on Injection Safety and Healthcare Waste Management Policy of the Federal Ministry of Health. The AIDS One study and other similar studies on this subject in Nigeria did not allow for statistically significant intervention–nonintervention differences to be made due to small study sample size.  There is need for a broad-based, nationwide study and interventions to strengthen Injection safety practices and healthcare wastes management systems in Nigeria. There is also a great need to develop strategies that would institutionalize sustainable injection safety and HCWM practices within facilities and in the environment that nurtures these facilities. This is the major focus of the objectives of this proposed study.\nIt is not known to what extent the provisions of this policy are implemented among healthcare workers especially in the apex healthcare facilities (the tertiary hospitals) in Nigeria. Most studies assessing injection safety practice and healthcare waste management in Nigeria have been carried out in district, primary healthcare facilities, general hospitals and mission hospital (hospitals owned and managed by religious bodies). It is necessary to study Injection safety practices and healthcare waste management among health workers in Tertiary (teaching) hospitals because such hospitals not only provide general healthcare services but are also centers for training of healthcare cadres who would in turn practice at other levels of healthcare services. There is thus need for a broad-based study of injection safety practice and healthcare waste management in teaching hospitals in Nigeria in order to generate research data on that level of healthcare delivery environment. Such data would facilitate the development of healthcare practice guidelines and practice framework that could easily cascade to the other levels of healthcare to ensure injection safety practices and healthcare waste management in the country.', 'Design and methodology\nStudy setting \nThe Nigerian healthcare system: Healthcare delivery system in Nigeria is broadly categorized into two sectors: the private sector and the public sector. The private sector comprise of the several privately owned hospitals / clinics, community pharmacies, nursing homes, patent medicines vendors shops and complementary or alternative healthcare providers, (traditional or herbal medicine practitioners, spiritual healers). These facilities are located in virtually every cities and villages in Nigeria. Most of these private healthcare centres are registered with and regulated by the Nigeria Federal Ministry of Health through its composite agencies while some of them operate in the shadow. The formal or public healthcare sector is stratified into three levels of primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities managed by the three tiers of government; local, state and the federal governments. At the base of this tier system are the primary healthcare centres located in virtually all cities and rural communities in the country. These health centres are managed by the local government authorities through healthcare professionals such as community health nurses, health extension workers, pharmacists and visiting or resident physicians.\nThe next level comprise the secondary healthcare facilities, (general hospitals) managed by the state governments. Virtually all states in the country have at least one general hospital located in their major cities and the rural communities. There are higher cadres of healthcare professionals that serve in these centres such as consultant physicians, medical officers, pharmacists, nurses, medical laboratory personnel and health records officers. At the apex of the formal healthcare system are the federal medical centres and university teaching hospitals attached to the federal universities in the country. These teaching hospitals are the tertiary and highest level of healthcare delivery in Nigeria. They serve as referral centres for the other tiers of healthcare where more complex healthcare cases are managed. They are also used for research, education / training of healthcare professionals. These hospitals are owned by the Nigerian federal government and the health personnel that work in them are made up of specialized cadres of healthcare professionals; professors, consultants, specialists and other cadres of staff from the various healthcare professions. We propose to select six teaching hospitals (one each from the six geopolitical zones in the country) for this project in order to achieve national spread and to generate more broad-based data that would assist in development of operational injection safety and healthcare wastes management practices in Nigeria. \nStudy design: This project is proposed to be a ‘before and after study’ cross-sectional study. \nStudy Population, sample size and data collection: The study shall be divided into the following stages:\n1. Baseline questionnaire survey on the awareness, attitudes about injection safety and healthcare waste management practices among healthcare workers. Participants shall be clinical and non-clinical staff members of the proposed research centres.

That project was successfully completed and we are completing the preparation of the final report to the funding organization, (the WHO). It is our belief that this Principal Researcher  has the requisite skills, expertise and experience to successfully complete this proposed project.', 'Strenghtening Implementation of the National Injection Safety and Healthcare Waste Management Policy among Healthcare workers in Nigeria', 'Nigeria', 'Abstract\nIntroduction\nInjection safety is defined by WHO as an injection that is administered using appropriate equipment, does no harm to the recipient, does not expose the provider to any avoidable risk and does not result in any waste that is dangerous to other people. A cross country survey showed that unsafe injection practice among health workers is high in developing countries with prevalence rate of as high as 80% in Nigeria. Health workers, patients and communities are exposed to unnecessary risk from unsafe injection practices and improper health care waste management. This takes heavy toll on both the human and material resources of the national economy and national development. There is thus need to contain the menace of unsafe injection and poor healthcare waste management in order to develop quality and safer healthcare and conserve national gross domestic product.\nExtent of the problem:\nThe WHO estimates that over 16 billion injections are given annually in developing and transitional countries. Hospitalized patients, including those infected with HIV are exposed to 10 to 100 times as many injections. It was shown that between 70% and 99% of these injections are unnecessary and over 50% of them are given in unsafe manner. Globally, unsafe injection was responsible for an estimated 21 million cases of HBV infection, 2 million cases of HCV infection, and 260,000 cases of HIV infection in the year 2000 alone. Estimates show that 9.18 million disability life adjusted years (DALYs) would be lost between the years 2000 and 2030 due to unsafe injection and poor healthcare waste management. Each year, the annual global burden of indirect medical cost due to HBV, HCV, and HIV/AIDS is estimated to be US$535 million. The WHO further estimated that over 501,000 deaths have occurred because of unsafe injection practices. These deaths could have been prevented through safe injection practices which include reduction of injections, compliance to safe injection practices and adequate healthcare waste management system. There is, therefore, need to strengthen injection safety practices and healthcare waste management among healthcare workers in Nigeria in order to curtail the menace of unsafe injections and poor healthcare waste management. \nBackground and Rationale\nIn developing countries such as Nigeria injection safety practices and proper health care waste management (HCWM) has not received adequate attention it deserves. Unsafe injection practices abound and hazardous and toxic wastes are put into dump facilities with few safeguards, if any, to protect the environment. Interventions by international donor agencies in Nigeria to combat infectious diseases have led to increased health services uptake with concomitant increase in injections and quantities of healthcare wastes. This has lead to a greater-than-ever need to strengthen safer injection practices and appropriate healthcare wastes management systems. Most injection safety and healthcare wastes management studies in Nigeria documented a poor implementation of the 2007 National Policy on Injection Safety and Healthcare Waste Management Policy of the Federal Ministry of Health. The AIDS One study and other similar studies on this subject in Nigeria did not allow for statistically significant intervention–nonintervention differences to be made due to small study sample size.  There is need for a broad-based, nationwide study and interventions to strengthen Injection safety practices and healthcare wastes management systems in Nigeria. There is also a great need to develop strategies that would institutionalize sustainable injection safety and HCWM practices within facilities and in the environment that nurtures these facilities. This is the major focus of the objectives of this proposed study.\nIt is not known to what extent the provisions of this policy are implemented among healthcare workers especially in the apex healthcare facilities (the tertiary hospitals) in Nigeria. Most studies assessing injection safety practice and healthcare waste management in Nigeria have been carried out in district, primary healthcare facilities, general hospitals and mission hospital (hospitals owned and managed by religious bodies). It is necessary to study Injection safety practices and healthcare waste management among health workers in Tertiary (teaching) hospitals because such hospitals not only provide general healthcare services but are also centers for training of healthcare cadres who would in turn practice at other levels of healthcare services. There is thus need for a broad-based study of injection safety practice and healthcare waste management in teaching hospitals in Nigeria in order to generate research data on that level of healthcare delivery environment. Such data would facilitate the development of healthcare practice guidelines and practice framework that could easily cascade to the other levels of healthcare to ensure injection safety practices and healthcare waste management in the country.', 'Design and methodology\nStudy setting \nThe Nigerian healthcare system: Healthcare delivery system in Nigeria is broadly categorized into two sectors: the private sector and the public sector. The private sector comprise of the several privately owned hospitals / clinics, community pharmacies, nursing homes, patent medicines vendors shops and complementary or alternative healthcare providers, (traditional or herbal medicine practitioners, spiritual healers). These facilities are located in virtually every cities and villages in Nigeria. Most of these private healthcare centres are registered with and regulated by the Nigeria Federal Ministry of Health through its composite agencies while some of them operate in the shadow. The formal or public healthcare sector is stratified into three levels of primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities managed by the three tiers of government; local, state and the federal governments. At the base of this tier system are the primary healthcare centres located in virtually all cities and rural communities in the country. These health centres are managed by the local government authorities through healthcare professionals such as community health nurses, health extension workers, pharmacists and visiting or resident physicians.\nThe next level comprise the secondary healthcare facilities, (general hospitals) managed by the state governments. Virtually all states in the country have at least one general hospital located in their major cities and the rural communities. There are higher cadres of healthcare professionals that serve in these centres such as consultant physicians, medical officers, pharmacists, nurses, medical laboratory personnel and health records officers. At the apex of the formal healthcare system are the federal medical centres and university teaching hospitals attached to the federal universities in the country. These teaching hospitals are the tertiary and highest level of healthcare delivery in Nigeria. They serve as referral centres for the other tiers of healthcare where more complex healthcare cases are managed. They are also used for research, education / training of healthcare professionals. These hospitals are owned by the Nigerian federal government and the health personnel that work in them are made up of specialized cadres of healthcare professionals; professors, consultants, specialists and other cadres of staff from the various healthcare professions. We propose to select six teaching hospitals (one each from the six geopolitical zones in the country) for this project in order to achieve national spread and to generate more broad-based data that would assist in development of operational injection safety and healthcare wastes management practices in Nigeria. \nStudy design: This project is proposed to be a ‘before and after study’ cross-sectional study. \nStudy Population, sample size and data collection: The study shall be divided into the following stages:\n1.

Two other researchers are in confirmation process including a consultant.', 'Interlocking the actor-network oriented in Indonesian: A Case of Open Educational Resource Policy Interfaces', 'Indonesia', 'As the most OER strategic products Electronic School Book (BSE) took the most controversial responses from many Indonesian people, particularly from education stakeholders. Based on the news published by the media in range of 2008-2013, debates about BSE policy could be framed into four main issues: equity, accessibility, quality, and coherence. For most students and teachers in Indonesia, especially for those living in rural areas, reading digital books is not something easier than reading printed textbooks which have become an integral part of their habit over the years. Even if a BSE is printed, it price will fall in the same range with the price of printed textbooks sold by the publishers. In terms of accessibility, BSE also perceived as an ineffective policy for many students and teachers in rural areas because lack of supporting facilities, such as limited electrical power resources, number of PCs allocation, Internet connection, and the unavailability of skilled instructors to operate ICT equipment and its applications. \nFrom the quality of content perspective, BSE also challenged reuse, revise, and remix of OERs basic principles. With very diverse geographical characteristics which consisted of 17,504 islands, over 500 ethnic identities, and lived in 3 different time zones. The Indonesian school system is also very immense. Based on current data, there were over 50 million students and 2.6 million teachers engaged in more than 250,000 schools. So far, there was no evidence obtained about the contents of BSE were being mixed and adapted into local learning needs, rather than treated as a supplement to the printed textbook purposes only. The budget of School Operational Assistance (BOS) that was integrated into the decentralization policy in education sector also requires schools to purchase textbooks from the publisher. This policy could certainly be perceived as not coherent with the BSE objectives. \nTherefore, it is not surprisingly if UNESCO stated that Indonesia does not have a Master Plan to implement a coherent and cohesive ICT across its education system. UNESCO’s report also indicated a number of barriers on the use of ICT in many schools in Indonesia, including the lack of adequate ICT equipment and infrastructure issues such as the unavailability of landlines phone, electricity supply insufficient; lack of skilled teachers who can integrate ICT in teaching and learning, unavailability of personnel to manage the ICT equipment, primarily in rural areas, and very high cost of Internet access in most of Indonesia.\nThis study situates community development and sustainable livelihoods approaches as forms of strategic thinking based on different value orientations within the development of OER policy sphere in Indonesia. The two approaches are presented as part of a continuum in the field of development; however in their differences we see reflected a critical shift in the relationship between the state, the market and people. Despite this difference, what they both share is a dismissal of the value contestations that underpin people’s livelihood interests and experiences. This argument is illustrated with a case from Indonesia, which demonstrates that open education policy through OERs capacity to act at a local level today must involve a willingness to tackle issues of value contestation and the impacts of globalization. This study therefore raises the main question of how OER policy values relate to the complexities of the everyday practicalities of livelihoods and livelihood discontinuities, and under what circumstances might OERs offer the best approach to a suitable education learning experience?', 'Inline with Fecher and Friesike (2013) which already cited on this call’s background paper, methodologically this study calls for a detailed ethnographic understanding of everyday life and of the processes by which images, identities and social practices are shared, contested, negotiated, and sometimes rejected by the various actors involved. This proposed project suppose to investigate the social interface’ which provides a useful heuristic device for identifying and analyzing the critical points of intersection between different fields or levels of social organization of OER policies. The actor-oriented approach to OER’s policy requires a strong sensitivity to the processes by which the practitioner enters the life worlds of the other social actors, and therefore implies a more reflexive type of understanding which will be embedded into this case in development research.\n\nThe utility of an actor-oriented approach is therefore that it forces us to inquire into how far specific kinds of knowledge are shaped by the power domains and social relations in which they are embedded and generated. This helps us to determine the degree to which specific actors’ life worlds, organizing practices and cultural perceptions are relatively autonomous of or dominated by wider ideological, institutional and power frames. \n\nThe term of social interface offers a way of exploring and understanding issues of diversity and conflict inherent in processes of external intervention. Interfaces typically occur at points where different, and often conflicting, life worlds or social fields intersect; or more concretely, in social situations or arenas in which interactions become oriented around problems of bridging, accommodating, segregating or contesting social, evaluative and cognitive standpoints. Social interface analysis aims to elucidate the types and sources of social discontinuity and linkage present in such situations and to identify the organizational and cultural means of reproducing or transforming them. In doing so, we can  develop a more adequate analysis of OERs policy transformation processes,  since it enables us to understand more fully the differential responses of local groups to planned interventions.\n\nAs an analytical framework to this method, social interface focuses on the linkages and networks that develop between individuals or parties rather than on individual or group strategies. Continued interaction encourages the development of boundaries and shared expectations that shape the interaction of the participants so that over time the interface itself becomes an organized entity of interlocking relationships and intentionality’s.\n\nIn more concrete way, based on the context of this proposed project, opinions on OERs development expressed by technical experts, extension learners seldom completely coincide; and the same is true for those working for a single government department with a defined policy mandate in education sector. Hence scientist, community based development players, publisher officers, ICT engineers, and the like, often disagree on the problems and priorities of education development. These differences cannot be reduced to personal idiosyncrasies but reflect differences laid down by differential patterns of socialization and professionalization, which often lead to miscommunication or a clash of rationalities. The process is further compounded by the coexistence of several different cultural models or organizing principles within a single population or administrative organization which creates room for maneuver in the interpretation and utilization of these cultural values or standpoints. It becomes necessary, therefore, to identify the conditions under which particular definitions of reality and visions of the future are upheld, to analyze the interplay of cultural and ideological oppositions, and to map out the ways in which bridging or distancing actions and ideologies make it possible for certain types of interface to reproduce or transform themselves.\n\nThe researcher and practitioner needs to access and learn lessons from the ‘autonomous’ settings in which people cope with their own problems, irrespective of whether or not the foci of concern or parameters of action can be linked with outside intervention of OER policy. This requires the adoption of a rigorous ethnographic stance. One must go to where people are already engaged in interactions, problem-solving activities or routine social practice and negotiate a role or combination of roles for oneself, as participant observer, active collaborator, and adviser.\n\nHence this proposed research will develop types of reflexive ethnography that explore the relationship between actors’ practical-everyday and researchers’ theoretical understandings of OERs problematic situations. The added value of this approach is that it enables us to consider the practitioner both researcher and field officer as part of the web of powers, constraints, opportunities and potentialities of specific OER intervention situations. Interface analysis offers a useful conceptual framework for achieving this.', 'The actor network approach along with interface analysis for this OER project, will provide a heuristic device for identifying the sites of social discontinuity, ambiguity and cultural difference, and sensitizes the researcher and practitioner to the importance of exploring how discrepancies of social interest, cultural interpretation, knowledge and power are mediated and perpetuated or transformed at critical points of confrontation and linkage.\nSuch interface analysis has a direct bearing on how one looks at policy processes. OER’s policy debates, including policy formulation, implementation and evaluation, are permeated by interface discontinuities and struggles. Indeed the whole process consists of an intricate series of socially-constructed and negotiated transformations relating to different institutional domains and differentially affecting a variety of actors. Hence an awareness of the dynamics of interface encounters and how they shape events and actor interests and identities is critical.\n \nWhatever the precise of OER’s policy issues and implementing structures, it is essential to avoid framing problems and looking for solutions from within a framework of formal-logical models and rationalistic procedures. Such approaches accord far too much weight to external expert systems and undervalue the practical knowledge and organizing capacities that develop among field level practitioners and local actors. After all it is the day-to-day decisions, routines, and strategies devised for coping with uncertainties, conflicts of interest and cultural difference that make or break OER’s policy. Indeed it has been persuasively argued that it is precisely at such implementation interfaces that de facto OER’s policy is created.  \n\nIn building a picture of everyday encounters and modes of organization and knowledge of OER policies, this project must be careful not to reify cultural phenomena, even if local people and OER policy makers do so themselves by using labelling or classificatory devices. The latter create simplifications or black boxes, like the idea of society being neatly divided into ‘ethnic communities’ or ‘class categories’, or planners’ visions of needy ‘target groups’ or ‘stakeholder categories’, that obscure rather than throw light on the diversity and complexity of social and cultural arrangements. Moreover such reifications enter into the very process of defining problems for solution, and in this way they may perpetuate existing ideal-typical models of what are ‘normal’ and ‘pathological’ conditions. \n\nThe multiplicity of interfaces associated with OERs development intervention provide a rich field for exploring this policy, since they throw into sharp relief all the ambivalences and complexities of cultural diversity and conflict. They also reveal the paradoxical nature of planned intervention of all kinds – even those promoting ‘participatory’ programmes – which simultaneously opens up space for negotiation and initiative for some groups, while blocking the interests, ambitions and political agency of others. What this proposed project need at the end is to convince the OERs’ policy makers and those development practitioners, in search of better project designs and management techniques, to reflect upon and share their firsthand experiences of ‘struggling at the interface’. In this way the actor-oriented framework could be further developed in relation to specific OERs policy practices.', 'In order to achieve the project objective and goals, this research proposed to employ a participatory monitoring and evaluation through following steps:\n\n1. Discuss and identify reasons for monitoring  \nStart by explaining the general purpose of monitoring to OER’s key actors and then facilitate a discussion about whether monitoring is important for them.  If the actors decide that monitoring is important, the researcher team will ask them to identify 2 or 3 concrete reasons why. Identifying that the actors place importance on the concept of monitoring and is interested in participating in monitoring is necessary before proceeding to the next step.\n \n2. Review objectives and activities of OERs project. Revisit with the actors the objectives of the project and the activities included. \n \n3. Develop monitoring questions  \nThe researcher team will facilitate a discussion in which the community identifies a series of monitoring questions (5 or less) which would be of interest for them to track throughout the life of the OERs project.  Begin this discussion without referring to the project’s monitoring questions to solicit fresh ideas from the actors, without community members thinking there is a right or wrong answer.  After the actors have identified their monitoring questions, present the project’s monitoring questions so that the actors are aware of what researcher team and partner staff will be tracking. If this is the actors’ first experience in participatory monitoring, this step will start with one monitoring question to slowly introduce the community to the concept and process.   \n \n4. Indicators identification\nThe researcher team will ask the actors to identify one or two indicators for each monitoring question.  The researcher team possibly be will spend a bit of time explaining the concept of indicators and give a few examples of less complex indicators.   \n \n5. Tools identification\nThe indicators identified by the actors may or may not require tools.  Tools can include basic worksheets (if there are literate actors interested in participating in data collection), participatory tools or discussions with key actors.   \n \n6. Decide who will monitor \nThe researcher team will ask the actors how the monitoring responsibility should be allocated.  Actors may prefer to have a few individuals collect the data while others may be interested in creating a monitoring committee.\n\n7. Results presentation and analysis\nThe researcher team will ask the actors how they would like to structure the analysis sessions and to present the results to the larger target groups.  Emphasize the importance of participation in analysis and involving more than just those who participated in collection.  \n\nThe researcher team also will develop a schedule of reflection events which allows the researcher and project staff to better plan for data use and is a step towards the integration of data use and reflection with the M&E system in the minds of staff.', '68.000 CAD', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/Letter_of_Endorsement_MN2.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudget4.xlsx', 171, NULL, 'complete', 'yes', 1410193602, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, 'yes');

The concept of &lsquo;socio-technical regime&rsquo; in the technology studies literature is a useful way of understanding this phenomenon. That literature emphasizes how incumbent technological systems, such as intensive agricultural production, comprise a mutually reinforcing &acute;regime&acute; of technological practices, knowledge, policy institutions, regulations and political interests.</p><p>Amongst other things, such configurations typically act as barriers to the creation and utilisation of alternative kinds of knowledge (e.g. because funding priorities, research agendas, technical skills, evaluation norms, etc are all heavily oriented to support incumbent technological practices). Alternative knowledge instead tends to be produced in &acute;niche&acute; spaces that operate outside of the constraints imposed by formal regime institutions.</p><p>The literature stresses the difficulties by which niche activities achieve broader impacts, and the processes whereby these may be overcome, for example by trying to persuade regime actors of the credibility and utility of niche-created knowledge. Our civil society-based organizations can usefully be characterized as &lsquo;niche&rsquo; open collaborative science (OCS) initiatives. We propose to study two such niche OCS initiatives.</p><p>The first comprises organizations that monitor and assess the health impact of pesticide use. A number of expert-civil society-based organizations have been formed to collect and analyze data on disease incidence in rural towns, using collaboratively designed methodologies in which both medical doctors, citizens and social movements participate. A key aim is to create an evidence base for regulatory control.</p><p>The second is an agro-ecological movement in which agronomists, small farmers, and several other actors develop agro-ecological protocols and practices, through collaborative initiatives that combine modern science and technology with traditional farming practices and indigenous knowledge. A key aim is to provide a means for small farmers to remain farming, and improve their livelihoods.</p><p>Although both OCS initiatives have had some social and policy impact, both face challenges in terms of obtaining broader influence, an important reason for which is that the knowledge they produce, and their status as knowledge producing bodies, are not considered by most actors within formal knowledge and governance institutions to be legitimate. Those challenges have been addressed by the niche OCS initiatives in different ways; a likely consequence of their different strategies, settings, disciplinary orientations, and aims. The main objective of this project is to learn, via a participative methodology, about the different strategies that each initiative has adopted to produce knowledge recognized more broadly as legitimate and useful, and the main challenges involved in doing so. That objective is located within Theme 1 of the call. We will explore the following kinds of questions.</p><ul><li>How has new knowledge been generated and diffused by each OCS initiative? How does each initiative understand the challenges of persuading other actors of the legitimacy of its organisation, and the knowledge it is creating?</li><li>What strategies has each initiative adopted to overcome such challenges, and hence achieve wider social influence?</li></ul><p>As a development outcome of the proposal we will develop a strategy that helps the groups to fulfill their objectives of becoming more influential. We will adopt a methodology that allows us to learn from the interaction between these two different groups and at the same for the groups to learn from each other.</p>', '<p>Specific objectives:</p><ol><li>To understand the different practices, strategies and methodologies adopted by niche OCS initiatives for the development and diffusion of knowledge To understand how those different initiatives gain material support, and enroll and build alliances with universities, agricultural research and extension services, and government departments.</li><li>To understand the key challenges that OCS initiatives face (e.g. both internally,in terms of knowledge production, and in relation to achieving credibility with mainstream institutions of knowledge production and utilisation), and the strategies that have been developed to try and overcome these.</li><li>To learn how OCS initiatives have influenced wider audiences in different areas including academic institutions, policy makers, legislators and media.</li><li>To develop a strategic plan that could enhance the performance of OCS groups that are trying to address health, inclusion and environmental challenges of industrial agriculture in Argentina Research design We will study and perform action research with two cases.</li></ol><ul><li>Case 1: University Network for Environment and Health (REDUAS in spanish) REDUAS was founded in 2010 following a conference of medical doctors and other scientists working on pesticide-related illness, and an NGO campaign and social movement against the unrestricted use of pesticides. The main aim of the network is to create evidence about pesticide related illness in a collaborative effort between rural residents and experts, and to empower rural medical teams and inhabitants affected by environmental ill-health. REDUAS coordinates scientific research, epidemiological analysis, health care and the dissemination and diffusion of information to improve public health. It is active in 10 provinces of the Republic Argentina with the participation of over twenty medical scientists.</li><li>Case 2: Network for the production and development of Agro-ecological technologies and organic production at the National Institute of Agricultural Technologies (INTA) - Argentina. This network was built to address the problem of isolation and lack of visibility of available agro-ecological capabilities and programmes in Argentina. The aim of the network is to produce synergies between the knowledge, capabilities and technologies available in INTA (Argentina&rsquo;s public sector research and extension service) and other institutions such as universities, cooperatives and farmers&rsquo; organizations.</li></ul><p>An important objective is to foster knowledge production on the methods, capabilities and technologies for sustainable and ecological agricultural systems, by using participatory techniques and methods of open science collaboration. Ultimately, the network regards agro-ecological knowledge as the result of the collaboration between the knowledge of local farmers and social movements advocating sustainability and food security, and scientific knowledge.</p><p>Currently the Network provides an umbrella for a broad range of research and open science techniques including those concerned with transitions to agroecological systems, agro-ecological pest management, and the retrieving of local seed and crop varieties.</p><p>Research methods We will combine three different methods: expert interviews, Delphi surveys and a final workshop in subsequent stages, as described below.</p><p>In the first stage we will perform in-depth interviews with key actors in both networks. At least 12 in-depth interviews per case will be performed. The goals include that of</p><p>a) learning about how key actors perceive the complexities and challenges of creating evidence - through novel expert-citizen-farmer collaboration - in ways that are recognised by more formal knowledge creating and utilising institutions as legitimate;</p><p>b) learning about how actors have tried to address those challenges and complexities, and with what success, for example in terms of formal and informal influence on universities, policy institutions, regulators, etc; and</p><p>c) how actors perceive the main barriers to achieving further credibility and legitimacy with mainstream institutions of knowledge production and utilisation. In the second stage we will develop a three round Delphi survey using an online questionnaire, based on what we have learnt from the earlier round of interviews. The Delphi technique allows researchers to learn about stakeholders&rsquo; assumptions and opinions through multiple iterations on a particular issue in order to approach consensus. This technique will be used to identify a hierarchy of the complexities and challenges faced by our OCS cases, and the kinds of strategic actions that could help diminish these.</p><p>This will be a key input to a roughly agreed strategic action plan shared by both communities. This questionnaire will be sent using online tools to all experts participating in both networks. In the third stage, near the end of the second year, we will organize a workshop. This will be used to derive a &ldquo;collective orientation&rdquo;, in order to discuss and validate the outcomes of the first and second stages of the research. The workshop will also be key to proposing and discussing a strategic action plan linking both networks.</p>', '<p>Both communities involved in the selected networks use OCS approaches to address key health, inclusion and environmental problems with industrial agriculture. However, although they are critically addressing the same technological production system, they do not necessarily collaborate, since they pursue different goals and are comprised of different types of actors, interacting in different contexts. One developmental goal of the project is to build bridges between both knowledge production groups (focusing, respectively on critique and promotion of alternatives), so as to enable learning between both the niche OCS initiatives and to support the creation of a shared strategy for future action, especially in relation to the challenges of producing different kinds of knowledge, in different ways, to those considered valid and legitimate by both formal knowledge producing institutions (e.g. universities) and formal knowledge utilising institutions (e.g. regulators and government departments).</p><p>Expected outputs at the end of the project are :</p><p>i)project report;</p><p>ii)policy briefs;</p><p>iii)an advanced proposal for 2 micro documentaries and/or audios;</p><p>iv)an online interaction platform for OCS communities and other stakeholders and</p><p>v)a workshop. We also expect to produce journal papers , ands follow up research proposals.</p><p>Development outcome 1</p><p>(DO1): interaction among OCS communities challenging industrial agriculture. Since our the selected networks do not necessarily collaborate, this project will build bridges between both innovative knowledge production groups in order support learning between, and the creation of a common strategy, for achieving wider legitimacy and influence for niche OCS-produced knowledge</p><p>DO2: Broadening the network of support of the OCS initiatives: We have identified six main stakeholders of this project: scientists and academics, policy makers, international organizations working in sustainable agriculture, NGOs, farmers and the general public. We have links with many representative of those stakeholders, and those links will be nurtured during the implementation of the project. They will be invited to participate in workshops and in the Delphi survey.</p><p>DO3: Diffusion and dissemination of the research activities and outcomes of the OCS initiatives. We will use advocacy and knowledge exchange to amplify achievements by OCS initiatives and our research findings from this project. Our affiliation in the international STEPS network, based at the University of Sussex in the UK, will allow us to increase the visibility of the activities of the OCS initiatives to a wider global audience. We plan two complementary strategies:</p><p>i)publications and conference papers for policy and research communities. We will also translate the research findings into policy advice and action for supporting OCS initiatives. ii)Reaching a wider audience. We believe there is a need for much wider social support for OCS communities; for example because a variety of contextual regulations and practices may constrain the utilisation of knowledge produced within niche OCS communities.</p><p>In this context, we will make efforts to design different dissemination strategies for a wider audience. For example, we will develop plans for audio production and micro-documentaries aimed at diffusing information about the issues raised by niche OCS initiatives.</p>', '<p>Quality control will be assessed internally and externally. Internally we will prepare terms of reference with the timeline for activities and responsibilities among collaborators and progress will be assessed continuously during team meetings. The research design allows for meaningful evaluation of success during implementation.</p><p>We are an experienced team of researchers, with an excellent track record in conducting externally funded research (IDRC, ESRC, DFID etc), and in delivering timely high quality research outputs. In terms of external quality control, our research methodology will ensure that the key stakeholders of the project provide feedback about the research design, diffusion processes and development aim.</p><p>There will be a series of consecutive and incremental steps of participation by stakeholders that will act to support internal quality control. Meaningful success and impact of the project overall will be evaluated, primarily, by reference to feedback from this group of immediate stakeholders.</p><p>In addition, we will draw on a wider network of academic colleague and advisors, especially via the STEPS Centre at Sussex. Adrian Smith, at STEPS/SPRU, has agreed to provide formal feedback during the implementation phase of the project and we will also seek other sources of formal and informal feedback from colleagues.</p>', '79778', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/support_CENIT5.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudget_stepsAL6.xlsx', 69, 254, 'complete', 'yes', 1411167766, 'complete', 'Timely topic.

(62, 'The Okavango Research Institute (ORI) has been involved in social-ecological research in northern Botswana for over a decade and has an experienced multi-disciplinary team of ecologists, sociologists, governance and rural development specialists and anthropologists. The team has conducted long-term research in the Okavango Delta and other areas of northern Botswana and is thus well acquainted with social-ecological conditions in African savannahs and wildlife regions. Our proposed research is thus a culmination of years of experience in critical issues relating to conservation strategy and policies, poverty alleviation and human-wildlife interactions. Our team, being locally-based, is also well connected with all the key stakeholders in the region, such as the Department of Agriculture, Department of Wildlife, Village Development Committees (VDC’s). We have worked with all these stakeholders on many projects, such as the Bio-Okavango project which sought to mainstream biodiversity management objectives into the main production sectors of the Okavango Delta, and are, therefore, able to form relevant partnerships with key stakeholders. The team has been working together in the proposed study area researching on the interactive influence of carnivore feeding behaviour and livestock husbandry on human carnivore conflict.  \nThe lead researcher from the ORI is Dr. Lucas Rutina.  Dr.  Rutina has worked as Biologist with the Department of Wildlife and national Parks for 19 years.    During this period he conducted research on wildlife population ecology and management.  The results of his research on the population dynamics of ostriches in the wild and under domestication influenced the development of the Ostrich management policy in 1994.  He also influenced the hunting system of game birds through a study on gallinaceous birds. He coordinated $10,000.00 joint lion surveys between the Department of wildlife and National Park and the hunting outfits. He also coordinated government projects worth more than 2 million USD at district and regional levels. Currently he has managed two projects:  one funded by the University of Botswana in the same study area on interactive influence of carnivore ranging behaviour on human-carnivore conflict and another funded by the Government of Netherlands on predicting Human-carnivore conflict (on-going).  \nThe collaboration with the Department of Wildlife (the custodian of wildlife in the country), Agricultural Research and Botswana College of Agriculture (which are responsible for research in rangelands and livestock production) will make the study a multidisciplinary research that will cover all aspects of the study. Both the PI and the collaborators have good knowledge of wildlife management since they have worked with the Department of Wildlife and National Parks.', 'Strengthening co-existence between carnivores and pastoralists:  improving livestock husbandry to enhance food security of agro-pastoralists in northern Botswana', 'Botswana', 'The relationships between people and carnivores are complex and are influenced by a variety of factors including: life history characteristics of carnivore species, the direct experiences between people and carnivores, and individual attitudes and values. Negative interactions that arise from the interaction between carnivores and pastoralists and private landowners, especially with respect to depredation of livestock by large carnivores, are a topic of international concern. In addition, landscapes shared by people and large carnivores have heightened risks for personal safety. These issues are often particularly significant in the regions surrounding protected areas where permeable boundaries allow for the free movement of animals across public and private domains to meet their life history requirements. Understanding the interactions between human and carnivore components of complex social ecological systems is essential to addressing the long-term sustainability and resilience of such systems. As in many regions of Africa, in Botswana, most rural inhabitants depend on pastoral farming for their survival. However, they experience high livestock losses due to carnivore depredation, drought and diseases transmitted from wildlife.  Currently interactions between the pastoralists and carnivores are common in Northern Botswana, resulting in safety concerns and economic losses to pastoralists through livestock depredation events. Without effective solutions to minimize these conflicts, negative reactions to carnivores will persist. The scope of this program is to establish a relationship with local community living on the boarder of Makgadikgadi and Nxai National Parks in northern Botswana and to develop methodology to better understand and communicate the issue through the development of predation risk maps. Risk maps have been used as early warning systems tool and target prevention actions.   Through the development of risk maps the local community will be engaged to share their knowledge and experiences to foster dialogue on improving co-existence of pastoralists and carnivores. \nThis action-oriented research aims at engage agro-pastoralists through a public participation in science framework to generate information and experiment on husbandries that reduces livestock losses. The research aims to address the food security issue among pastoralists with a holistic multidimensional approach aimed at assessing the level of food insecurity, examining the policies that govern livestock production, examining health challenges for cattle and pastoralists and examining the socio-ecological factors influencing livestock depredation by large carnivores, devising improved livestock management strategies that improve rangeland condition and stability of cattle production. Specific objectives are: 1. To asses the level of food security risks experienced by agro-pastoralists in the study area, 2. To asses the influence of policies and management strategies on livestock production and predation by carnivores, 3. To experiment strategies that can allow agro-pastoralists to create, maintain and benefit from spatial heterogeneity of grazing resources, 4. To investigate health challenges (human and animal) experience by agro-pastoralists and 5. To identify and model socio-ecological factors that influence livestock depredation by carnivores. The expected outputs will be the development of livestock management strategies that reduce livestock depredation and disease transmission from wildlife, while increasing the stability and productivity of livestock and crop production.', 'Our study will involve in situ studies and will aim to strike good balance between academic excellence and developmental issues. Thus, a systems approach emphasizing on community and stakeholder engagement driven by a trans-disciplinary team of senior researchers, post docs and students will be adopted. Agro-pastoralists in these site experience high level of livestock losses and some households are opting for government poverty alleviation programs.  60 households will be randomly selected to participate in the study.  30 households will be directly participating in the experiments and 30 will act as controls. In each study group 15 (5 with less than 50 livestock and 5 with more than 50 -100 livestock and 5 with more than 100) households will be male headed and 15 female headed.\n\nObjective 1: To analyses changes in food security due to the project with emphasis on livestock contribution, livelihoods strategies and food security will be assesses at the initial, mid and end of the project using a combinations of household impact strategies and household economic assessment methods. \n\nObjective 2: To determine the influence of key national policies on the production of small scale livestock production, key national policies that have direct influence on livestock production and carnivore predation will be identified. Their contribution and influence will be analyses using content analysis instruments.  Agro-pastoralists will be interviewed using semi-structured questionnaire to assess their perceptions on identified policies. Analysis of documents on national/international health policies and regulations, and interviews with key informants, will be conducted to determine policy/economic drivers \n\nObjective 3: For the test households, full-time herders will be selected, employed and trained on cattle herding and overnight corralling techniques. Potential grazing areas in the area will be surveyed, with vegetation types and habitats being mapped on a GIS system. Specialized carnivore-proof mobile corrals will be manufactured according to a tried and tested method used in the Matetsi Safari Area in adjacent Zimbabwe. \n\nObjective 4: Data will be gathered from a variety of sources, carnivore and prey density studies, remote sensing of vegetation, past depredation events and local knowledge gathered form the community. Wildlife distributions and habitat selection (carnivores and herbivores) will be monitored in the adjacent protected areas to observe how wildlife responds to livestock presence/absence.  Wildlife habitat use will also provide information on spatial interactions between livestock and wildlife and how this may affect disease transmission and depredation by carnivores. Wildlife distribution data will be derived from satellite collars on the main wildlife species in each region as well as from direct observation techniques using driven aerial surveys, road transects, and dung density surveys on walked transects. Radio tracking using GPS collars, spatial analysis to define home ranges and spatial overlaps, contacts patterns analyses using network analysis, and field surveys to characterize key environmental variables. Social surveys using key informants interviews and questionnaires, to document livestock management practises and perception of risks associated with wildlife\n\nThese datasets will be used to produce run logistical regression to produce seasonal GIS models of the probability of predation risk within the study area. Community Engagement: Semi-Structured Interviews with closed and open ended questions will be conducted on households to acquire farmers’ Knowledge on distribution of carnivore and prey species, extent of conflict, mitigation strategies and potential value of ecotourism as income generating livelihood opportunity. Cluster sampling will be used to select number of cattle posts in relation to distance from Protected Area. Cattle posts from each cluster will be chosen using simple random and households from selected cattle posts will also be randomly sampled and interviewed.', 'Development of predation risk map \n?

He together with a colleague conducted a study (in 2008) on the assessment of the extent of pollution of Kitwe stream, a stream that passes through the industrial centre of the Kitwe city, in the republic of Zambia. He has also worked with Daphnia magna for analysis of various biomarkers. Towards the end of 2012, he worked with Professor Peter van den Hurk, from Clemson University (USA), on the sampling of fish from the Savannah River for measurement of a variety of biomarkers in the fish. The Savannah River has multiple point sources where pollutants are released into the river, and as part of the project, he assisted in the collecting of fish samples near these point sources, and also further downstream. \n\nAmong the research collaborators, there is a specialist in molecular techniques which will augment the determination of biomarkers that are indicative of compromised reproductive capacity of fish (e.g.  Vitellogenin). There is also a GIS specialist, Pesticides analysis specialist, Fish biologists and sediment and water specialists.', 'The assessment of the pollution of the Kafue River: Implications for Fish Health and Reproduction', 'Zambia', 'The significant decrease in fish abundance and consequently a steady decrease in the catch per unit effort (CPUE) in the Kafue River is threatening the livelihoods of over 40 % of Zambia’s population, especially people along this river watershed. Interestingly, the decrease in fish abundance has largely been attributed to influences such as altered flooding due to impoundments, increased fishing and introduction of some invasive fish species. However, other critical factors such as chemical pollution from both point sources and non-point sources along the river basin have not been comprehensively investigated. Several studies conducted on the Kafue River have concentrated mainly on assessment of heavy metal pollution in localized sections of the Kafue River Basin. Given that besides mining and mineral processing plants, there are several other chemical industries, wastewater treatment facilities and farms dotted around certain stretches of the Kafue River, it is expected that a variety of other chemical pollutants can be found in water, sediment and biota. Few studies have in fact confirmed the presence of a variety of other chemical pollutants including pesticides, PCBs and other contaminants of emerging concern (CEC). In fact, very little is known about the effect of chemical pollution on fish health and reproduction. This study intends to investigate the association between chemical pollution and fish reproduction throughout the entire Kafue Basin, using an array of biochemical parameters that include heavy metals, pesticides, estrogenic compounds, gross morphometric indices and biomarkers. Ultimately, this study should recommend the possible restorative measures for the Kafue River for increased fish reproduction.', '1.

Determination of pollutants and other indicators\n\n2a: Conduct sampling of water samples, sediments and fish at each sampling site. Water and sediment samples will be collected in triplicates per sampling site per season. Random water samples will be collected using glass/plastic containers. Sediment samples will be collected using augers, while fish samples will be collected from appropriate sites.\n\n2b: Heavy metals: The water samples, sediments and fish tissues will be appropriately digested in acids, like sulphuric, nitric, perchloric and hydrofluoric acids. The samples will after appropriate dilutions be analyzed using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), inductively coupled plasma –optical emission (ICP-OES) or inductively coupled plasma –mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) depending on the concentration levels of the selected heavy metals. The heavy metals of toxicological relevance such as Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Cr, As, Hg, Ni, Co, Mn, Mg, Sb, Se, and Bi will determined.  \n2c: Pesticides: The water samples, sediments and fish tissues will be appropriately extracted for the relevant pesticides using appropriate solvents such as acetone, acetonitrile, Hexane, Iso-octane or combination thereof.

Total plate counts, total coliforms and faecal coliforms will be determined in water samples. Additionally, streptococci will be determined as an indicator of waste pollution of animal origin in the river.  \n2f: Morphometric indices: Approximately 10 fish samples per sampling site per season will be weighed and length measured. Additionally, the fish will be dissected to remove gonads and livers which will be weighed to determine the gonadal and hepato-somatic indices. The gender of the fish will be determined.\n\n2g: Biomarkers: Blood, liver and bile will be extracted from fish samples and purified to determine the concentrations of various biomarkers. Among some biomarkers to be determined in this study include AChE which indicates the organophosphates exposure, EROD for the indication of PAHs exposure, ALAD for the indication of lead exposure and MT for indication of metal exposure.  For indication of oxidative stress, enzymes such as GST, Catalase, SOD, GSH peroxidase and GSSG will be determined. Other biomarkers to be examined will be Bile fluorescence which is indicative of PAH exposure, TBARS indicator of oxidative stress damage of lipids, Vitellogenin indicative of estrogenic compounds or EDCs, UGT indicative of exposure to phenols and estrogen. These biomarkers will be determined using commercially available absorbance and fluorescence plate readers, with MT being determined using electrophoresis.', 'The scientific evidence and knowledge to be generated from this research study will be used to develop a restorative and ecosystem conservation programme for the entire Kafue Basin.

She is also gender activist and researcher in the gender dimensions of innovations and technology. She is expected to contribute and facilitate gender and technology inputs into the analysis of OFR.', 'Relevance and Disparities of ICTs to Coordination of On-Farm Research for Sustainable Food Production in Tanzania', 'Tanzania', 'Problem: On-Farm Research (OFR) was adopted by countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) including Tanzania as a driver to collaborative agricultural technology development and transfer that incorporate actual farming environments of smallholder farmers. A popular OFR design is Farmer-Designed and Farmer Implemented (FDFI), where farmers becomes the manager of the process. Researchers and extension officers become facilitators by providing technical input to the process. Another design is Researcher-Designed and Farmer-Implemented (RDFI). A well coordinated collaboration is therefore key to achievement of desired outputs. Farmers, researchers and extension officers have to work in a coordinated manner during planning, implementation and post-implementation phases. Government and other partners have invested or showed interests in investing in network infrastructure and technology to improve research and development activities. However, such investment has not been distributed equitable in both rural and urban or within rural or urban areas. In addition, their relevance in support of OFR activities and eventually sustainable food production have not been thoroughly studied. \n\nResearch questions: The study focuses on technology and infrastructure as well as community engagement aspects of OCS. It seeks to answer the following questions:\ni)     How do ICTs in their multiple nature and existing ecosystem support planning, implementation and post-implementation of OFR activities?\nii)    How do the use of ICTs in OFR engage participants to address the sustainability indicators of food production and security in the study areas?\niii)    How does ICT infrastructure investment promotes the use of ICT in coordination of OFR in different agro-ecological zones?\niv)    Which disparities exist in accessibility and utilization of ICTs in OFR in the study area?\nv)    Would the current agro-ecological zones, in view of access to and utilization of ICTs, be termed as agro-technical zones?\n\nDevelopmental challenge: Eradicating extreme poverty and hunger through sustainable food production and security is the first priority goal among eight (8) Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is also factored  in local policy, strategies and programmes in Tanzania, including Agriculture and Food Security Policy, National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (NSGRP) and Tanzania Vision 2015. Like wisely, promotion of gender equality and women participation and develop a global partnership in development are goals number three (3) and eight (8) respectively. This study focuses on these challenges in the context of OFR. The OFR is one of the approaches that can contribute to the three goals through improved food production and collaboration in scientific knowledge generation and sharing. ICTs are seen as vehicles towards achieving these goals. OFR requires the use of ICTs to effectively put its many stakeholders and activities in good coordination. However, ICT ecosystems is changing rapidly in terms of hardware, software, skills and procedures calls for assessing their relevance. \n\nRationale and significance: Importance of OFR extends to the fact that food production and security in Tanzania is contributed at large by smallholders farmers. They consist of about 70% of population mainly living in rural or peri-urban areas. Most OFR designs place the farmer at the centre of planning, design, actual technology development and its dissemination.Relevance of ICTs has recently been the topmost cross-disciplinary research agenda in both industrialized and developing countries. The relevance of Information Technology (IT) and Communication Systems (CS) was the first priority of four research areas that were recommended by the Committee on Computing Research for Environmental and Societal Sustainability for the United States of America (USA) and the rest of the World. The Commission of European Union (EU) through its Framework Programme Seven (FP7) and recently Horizon 2020 has singled out ICTs for Societal challenges as an emerging research and innovation area. The Commission believes that societal challenges would be tackled by multidisciplinary application driven research and innovation leveraging ICTs. \n\nIn the East African Region, the East African Community (EAC) has earmarked the continuing needs for data and information as a potential gateway to better participation, transparency and accountability. The evaluation of EAC strategy for 2005 – 2010 reveal that despite the implementation of some projects, ICTs remained vital for transformation of the Region into the centre for information sharing and communications. In Tanzania, agricultural sector has embraced ICTs through deployment of various hardware and software tools and methods for decision making, coordination and control for sustainability production. However, they have not yet been confirmed to be relevant to local, national and regional situations. Along these, the disparities in accessibility and utilization have not been thoroughly studied.', 'The study area: The study area will focus on three agro-ecological zones and where OFR are carried out extensively. These include Lake Victoria Zone, Southern Highlands Zone and Eastern Zone. Each of these zones is served by zonal research and development institute. The Institutes are namely Ukiliguru, Uyole and Ilonga respectively. The zones are also popular in OFR for a variety food crop production. This study will focus on maize and rice crops across each of the three zones. These are also the leading and most popular cereal food crops in the Tanzania.\n \nResearch Approach: Research will follow a comparative case study approach, where detailed data and information will be collected from each zone. Researchers serving the zones in the particular crop being studies, extension officers serving the villages and farmers in the villages will be selected irrespective of whether they are using ICTs or not.\n \nResearch Design: The research will adopt sequence design of mixed methods to data collection and analysis. In this design, qualitative (QUAL) is sequentially followed by quantitative (QUAN) paradigms. However, as it is often argued, sequential design would not necessarily attach equal weight to methods from each of the QUAL and QUAN paradigms.\n\n Output-oriented Methods of Data collection and analysis:\n\nOutput 1:  Relationship between ICT utilization and its support to OFR coordination activities developed\n1.1    Selection of at least two villages from each zone where OFR are carried out almost at the same levels. The main selection criteria will be OFR participation for at least 10 consecutive years.\n1.2    Preliminary visits to selected villages to create rapport including seeking local administrative support.\n1.3    Preparation of research tools including structured questionnaires and guide to focus discussions.\n1.4    Collection of data through administration of questionnaires, conduct focus group discussions, interview Key Informants, observe and document facts.\n1.5     Analysis of data using quantitative and qualitative techniques such as Content analysis through NVivo package and descriptive, correlation and t-test analyses using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS).\n\nOutput 2:  Knowledge on the contribution of ICTs to engagement of OFR participants for sustainable food production created\n2.1    Collaborative development of sustainability indicators of food production among research scientists, farmers and extension officers through focus group discussions after activities 1.1 - 1.2.\n2.2    Preparation of research tools focusing on logical link between the use of ICTs, engagement of OFR participants and sustainability indicators of food production.\n2.3    Collection and analysis of data using the same methods as shown under activities 1.4 - 1.5 above.\n\nOutput 3:  Relationship between access to network infrastructure and coordination of OFR activities using ICTs established\n3.1    A quick scan on network infrastructure availability through observation and key informant interviews after activity 1.1 but during activity 1.2\n3.2    Preparation of research tools with items focusing on network infrastructure and their support to ICT use in coordinating OFR activities.\n3.3    Collection and analysis of data using the same methods as shown under activities 1.4 - 1.5 above.\n\nOutput 4:  Disparities disclosed between access to and utilization of ICTs in the three agro-ecological zones\n4.1    Identification of disparities to focus on after activities 1.1 and 1.2\n4.2    Preparation of research tools with items focusing on disparities identified in 4.1 above.\n4.3    Collection and analysis of data using the same methods as shown under activities 1.4 - 1.5 above.\n\nOutput 5:  The technical status of access to and utilization of ICTs in the three agro-ecological zones established\n5.1    Comparison criteria of different agro-ecological zones with respect to accessibility and utilization of ICTs established after all activities under output 1 - 3.\n5.2    Use results of output 4 activities to compare the zones.\n5.3    Conduct comparative Analysis to compare the zones.\n\nInformation presentation: Information resulting from data analysis activities for each output will be summarized and presented in form of Tables, charts, and graphs.', 'Created awareness on the relevance of ICTs to coordination activities within OFR: OFR is a a scientific collaboration set of activity relevant to OCSDNet. It is non-conventional platform that brings together technology  developers (researchers), technology transfer (extension officers) and technology adoption (farmers). The activities by the three parties are successful if well coordinated. The role of ICTs in bringing the coordination is well documented. However, the relevance in terms of the relationship between the activities, the ICT tools and the goals are not well known and shared. This study contributes to fill such a gap as well as contributing in the debates to reinforce OFR in developing countries.\n \nInformed policy and decisions regarding OFR design, implementation and sharing: Policy and decision makers are interested in evidence-based input to their processes. The research will contribute to informing their processes through a number of publications and multi-channel dissemination strategy. These includes leaflets, brochures, articles in newspaper, conference papers, journal papers and talk shows in community radio and television.\n \nUnderstood link between ICT and food production and security among smallholders: The project shall inform the policy, decision makers and other stakeholders with regards to current trends and importance of ICTs in food productions, thus guide decisions and policies on investment in ICT for agriculture in Tanzania. Such information is required in planning and policy making processes.\n \nEstablished disparities on access to and utilization of ICT in OFR: The project shall create and share information regarding the farming systems based disparities to accessibility and utilization of ICTs and the implications on OFR participation and food security in general. Deeper analysis on disparities will include by type of ICT infrastructure, by education, by financial capitation and by gender. Information will help researchers, extension officers, farmers, decision and policy makers to respond to the identified gaps and recommendations made.\n\nKey Concept availed for Development of OCS Framework within Agriculture or Food Security Themes: The research will avail some concepts and their relationship that may contribute to knowledge creation through Conceptual frameworks. these concepts may also contribute to existing debates on relevance of ICTs and the effects of disparities or digital divide.', 'Baseline information will be developed using farmers, researchers and extension officers who have participated in on-farm research but have not used ICT solutions because of reasons either within or outside their control. These will include researchers biased with OSR, farmers and extension officers who had no opportunity to participate in OFR. These will form a basis for evaluation of process, outcome and eventually impact of the OFR as a non-conventional OCS strategy.\n \nMonitoring activities will be done through regular team meetings to assess the achievement of milestones of activities and outputs, review of existing and future activities. Furthermore, monitoring will also make some adjustment to ensure that implementation is smooth and according to work plan.\n \nProcess and outcome evaluation will be done during year 1 and year 2 of the project implementation respectively. Evaluation criteria will include completion of project activities in a planned duration, challenges encountered and how were solved, outputs and their dissemination and overall level of achievement of the project objectives.\n \nImpact evaluation is an ex-post activity scheduled to happen a year or two after completion of the project. However, by the nature of this project, judgement about the relevance of ICTs to coordination of OFR could answer some questions related to impact of using and or using ICTs on OFR-based food production and security activities.', 'CAD$ 78,000.00', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/OCSDNet_-_Institutional_Endorsement_Letter.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudget-_Hector_Mongi.ods', 93, 260, 'complete', 'yes', 1411159117, 'complete', 'Budget on transportation and travel are too high.

This last indicator is one of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) indicators. MDG1 aims to halve the prevalence of underweight children under five years of age in Tanzania from 28.8% (1990 baseline) to 14.4% by 2015 (MPEE, 2006), which will only be achieved with much greater, focused effort\n\nAlthough there is a large potential possibility of minimizing and eradicating the problem, but communities have not been aware, sensitize, trained on what to do to solve the problems. There are available local materials that if fully and technically utilize they can be of great potential to solve the food insecurity hence eradicate or minimizing malnutrition among the rural communities.\nLack of health education and food processing education in the rural areas are believe to be the major reasons why Tanzanian children are stunted and suffering from malnutrition a major cause of sickness, disease and death children and pregnancy women due to poor and weakened immune system\n\nThe project is going to addressing answers for the following questions;\nCan a food product rich in micro and macro nutrients being developed from locally available plant materials?\n\nCan the process control parameters for post-harvest handling and manufacturing, maintain the efficacy of functional food ingredients from indigenous plant materials throughout the food value chain?\n\nCan the private sector in collaboration with R & D institutions introduce into the market new food products with quick cooking properties, real nutritional benefits, desirable texture, good taste, stable shelf life, and optimum materials utilization?\n\nFarming of Moringa oleifera trees as a commercial crop will both help the farmers realize income and health benefits at the same time. Moringa is rich source of nutrition for people of all age groups.

Currently is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health at the School of Public Health and Social Sciences, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS), Dar-es-Salaam. She worked as a Research scientist in-charge of the toxicology research at the Tropical Pesticides Research Institute (TPRI), Arusha, Tanzania since 1980.  Principal Investigator for the Tanzania portion of the East Africa Pesticide Network project funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Ottawa, Canada and supported by the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (FIOH), Helsinki, Finland from 1989 to 1997. The project involved assessing the health hazards posed by pesticide handling, storage and use on large and small scale farms in Tanzania. Was Main Collaborator and Co-Investigator of a collaborative project between Tanzania and South Africa funded by Fogarty International Center, USA which looked at the Health and Economic Consequences of Pesticide Usage in Tanzania and South Africa (2003-2005) and Project Manager/Scientist for a collaborative project jointly driven by the TPRI, later by MUHAS and University of Cape Town, South Africa, the Work And Health in Southern Africa (WAHSA): Action on Pesticides project, funded by Sida (2004-2009). \nUnder the East Africa Pesticide Network project, acute effect of organophosphorus pesticides in coffee farm-workers was studied in 1989-92 involving 133 farm-workers to provide basis for concern over farm workers overexposure during pesticide application. The study found no association between symptoms reported and Acetyl-cholinesterase depression. During the same period, organochlorine pesticide residues were analyzed in 1326 human serum samples from the East African farming population. Concentrations of selected organochlorine pollutants were measured with gas chromatography-electron capture detector, to assess the intensity of pesticide absorption with a view to developing strategies to minimize exposures and poisoning. p,p''-DDT, o,p''-DDT, p,p''-DDE, o,p’DDE, p,p''-DDD, ?-, ?-BHC, lindane, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, ?-, ?-endosulfan, endosulfan ether, were the most frequently identified residues. p,p’DDE presented the highest frequency and concentration (964 ppb), concentrations ranging from 0.11 to 964 ppb followed by p,p’DDT (0.18-245 ppb). Under the Work and Health in Southern Africa (WAHSA): Action on Pesticide Health Impact, farmers in Ngarenanyuki and Mang’ola were empowered to monitor pesticides health impacts on themselves through a community-based surveillance and make decisions that will contribute to the sustainable reduction of the risks of pesticides. The trained farmers continued sharing the knowledge and skills gained from the training offered and in 2011, the farmers in Ngarenanyuki shared very impressive experience, more than five years since they were taught, with students from MUHAS who were on study tour.\nThis project draws in a wide range of disciplines, bringing together occupational health, epidemiology, social science, chemical analysis, economics and policy analysis.', 'Control of hazards associated with pesticides handling in Tanzania: A case of horticultural farming in Northeastern Tanzania', 'Tanzania', 'More than 30 years since the first pesticide registration and control law was passed in Tanzania in 1979, pesticides are still used haphazardly and the scale of pesticide poisonings in the country is unknown. Pesticides are widely used to boost agricultural production, which is central to the Tanzania economy and critical for food security. However, in estimating risks and benefits of pesticide use, available to understand the adverse impacts of pesticide use, both for the environment and for human health is scanty. Also, costs of pesticide use are often ignored, leading to externalisation in cost-benefit analyses. For example, organophosphate (OP) pesticides are known to be neurotoxic to humans following high-dose acute exposures typical of intoxications. Less clear, however, is whether OP’s are capable of causing neurotoxicity under “normal” use conditions in the absence of intoxication. Survivors of acute poisonings have shown long-term cognitive and psychomotor impairments which predispose them to further injuries and poisonings. However, research showing a link between “routine” uses in the absence of a poisoning is equivocal on long-term health effects. Such a finding would have important implications for how we manage pesticides and the trade-offs we make in our policy choices for sustainable agriculture, particularly in Tanzania where majority of the population are vulnerable. \n\nFurthermore, among the effects of globalization, privatization, and trade liberalization is increased demand for pesticides and availability of sub-standard and fake pesticides on the Tanzania open market. This calls for new strategies that will allow researchers and pesticide regulator to disseminate scientific knowledge openly and freely to help vulnerable communities. Effective pesticide regulation in Tanzania is confounded by weak regulatory capability; inadequate infrastructure; and the international trade that hinder implementation of regulatory controls. Notwithstanding, the concerns on human and environmental health impact and increased cost of crop production due to injudicious use of pesticides, the government is promoting increased use through “Kilimo Kwanza”, that is, Agriculture First and Big Result Now (BRN) campaigns. Developing capacity of farming communities to determine the actual costs and carry out self-surveillance and monitoring of hazards associated with use, handling, storage and disposal of pesticides and associated waste will inform decision making in the crop protection system to improve health and increase production.\n\nThis project will therefore study the impacts of pesticides on human health and farmer productivity in Tanzania by quantifying the extent of pesticide problems and empower communities to take action themselves and advocate for policy change. Also, internationally, the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent (PIC) provides a mechanism for severely hazardous pesticides to be restricted based on evidence of harm to communities which the project will also seek to address. To monitor pesticide impact on health and environment and take action represent a viable solution to promote health for a significant share of the population and hence improve productivity and economy at large.\n\nA link of neurobehavioural impairment/injury to lost productivity will enable accurate estimation of the costs of pesticide usage, so as to avoid the typical problem of externalising costs. Previous attempt by the principal research to develop tools for costing pesticides ended at development stage hence, developed tools will be adapted for this study. The linkage will be important for informing pesticide policies in the country, which is dependent on agriculture for economic development, and where rural populations may be particularly vulnerable because of poverty, low literacy, HIV infection and malnutrition. Important prevention measures may be identified from the findings to reduce the burden of disease posed by pesticides and the risks of environmental contamination, typically of water sources.  Interventions to be developed out of the study findings will focus on training programmes and materials to enable safe and sustainable agricultural production, maintaining farmer productivity whilst minimising risks to human health and the environment.\n \nMuhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS)’s value on social responsibility, accountability and visionary leadership in responding to issues and expectations of the society makes the University able to lead the pesticide regulator and the ASP (T) Network, an NGO, to study the communities in North-eastern Tanzania and improve their health and economy through judicious use of pesticides. Involvement of communities in pesticide research is new and shown to be a good strategy for controlling hazards due to pesticide handling.', 'This study was in Arusha region which is one of the 27 regions of Tanzania with one and a half million inhabitants of whom 80 percent live in rural areas and depend on agricultural activities for their living. The population is located in five districts composed of 120 wards sub-divided into 360 villages. The main occupation of the people is agriculture, followed by animal husbandry and a few do business and mineral prospecting.  Arusha region is among the regions with high pesticide use in both horticulture and other food crop farming and has a large number of pesticide retailers. The study will be conducted in Mang’ola and Ngarenanyuki in North-eastern Tanzania, where horticulture and floriculture are emerging non-traditional exports that utilizes a lot of pesticides for pest control. Onions are of great importance in Mang’ola area whereas in Ngarenanyuki tomatoes form the vegetable bulk. Other crops grown and treated with pesticides are beans,  cabbages, spinach and flowers. Previous studies revealed unsafe practices in the application of the pesticides leading to high exposures and environment contamination leading to progressive pollution of the food chain.  \n\nThe study will use community self-surveillance coupled with state of the art exposure and outcome assessment methods to explore pesticide exposure-effect relationships. The design will involve cohort study in which a cohort of farmers will be recruited and followed up for 18 months. It will have a preparatory stage where research team members will meet to launch the project, lay out strategies and define roles for implementation; establish contacts with authorities in study area; recruit students; organize management teams in the study areas; prepare tools and procure equipment, orient research team, train students on cholinesterase assay techniques and neurobehavioral assessment methods. The implementation stage will involve training of management teams and community members on regulation, economic, health and safety aspects of pesticide use as well as how to carry out self-surveillance using a tool specifically designed for that purpose. The tool was adapted from the FAO Manual developed by Helen Murphy for Asia pacific and piloted by the research team in the study area and results published. Students and health care providers at health centres in the study area will conduct the tests at agreed intervals and as need may arise.  The study will focus on communities in small-scale horticultural farms in the selected areas in North-eastern Tanzania.\n \nSix hundred (600) small-scale farmers and family members in North-eastern Tanzania over a period of 18 months, recording pesticide handling events and safety practices, measuring exposure to pesticides, potential non-occupational routes of exposure and other potential confounding factors (such as alcohol use and other medical conditions). Exposure to pesticides will be assessed prospectively using a combination of structured work diary on all participants and biomarkers on a sub-sample of farmers to validate the exposures.  The study will measure at baseline and at agreed intervals within 18 months a set of neuro-behavioural and neuropsychological outcomes using standardised batteries to assess cognitive, affective and psychomotor functions as well as vibration threshold as an early marker of neurotoxicity. Change in outcomes will be related to pesticide exposures to ascertain the presences and strength of causal relationships and any dose-response relationships. Additionally, prospective data on injury will be collected in the course of the 18 month to model the relationship between pesticide exposure, neuro-behavioural impairment and consequent injury. Finally, farmer productivity will be measured in the group, and costing done, thereby enabling an economic model to be applied to any neuro-behavioural impairment identified. This will enable the study to provide a comprehensive picture of the impacts of pesticide exposure on human health and on farming productivity, with a view to making recommendations for sustainable agriculture and for development of training interventions with farmers to reduce human exposures and environmental contamination.\n\nExposure measured from community self-surveillance forms and biomarkers. Outcomes include standardised neurobehavioural test batteries, vibration threshold, and data on injury. The study will make recommendations for preventive measures to support sustainable development. The government collaborator (Registrar of Pesticides) will support training of management teams and self-reporting farmers, and NGOs collaborator will follow up self-surveillance process and outcome assessment tools. The University investigators will train the management teams and self-reporting farmers, mentor students and perform field research preparations, and data analysis and reporting.', '• Collaboration serve as the basis for disseminating training and safety materials, implementing improved surveillance for pesticides poisoning, policy interventions to reduce pesticide use and capacity building at all levels\n• Improved health- Data from surveillance is used for preventive action\n• Improved food security- Judicious use of pesticides\n• Sustainable horticultural production-Reduced exposure to pesticides and environmental contamination \n• Socio-economic status of the community improved.

However, as noted above, it will collaborate closely with the NGO and the community.\n \nTo ensure consistent and timely project evaluation, and, when necessary corrections, an internal monitoring procedure will be developed to regularly collect information on how the project work is being executed. Detailed work plan will include monitoring elements such as indicators of progress and the time frame in which different project activities shall be executed or delivered. The project will therefore use this instrument as a tool for monitoring. \n\nProject monitoring will be conducted through continuous internal or self monitoring.

We constitute a multidisciplinary team where all are at the same level of expertise and compromise with the project. The researcher named first, Miriam Pinto, is coordinating the group. \nMiriam Pinto graduate in chemistry in 1990, received her Master Degree in Science in 1994 and her Doctorate in Production Engineering in 1999 specifically in S&T management. Her main motivation to migrate from basic science to S&T management was a profound necessity to find ways to make S&T effectively help to change the reality of the poor people living in ‘favelas’ in Brazil. \nFrom 2000 to 2010, she concentrated her efforts in under graduation teaching in the areas of strategic management, quality management and innovation management in engineering courses. In 2006, she started a project to promote engineering students integration with ‘favelas’ dwellers and their problems. NGOs made the link between university students and the community members. Students’ efforts generated low tech and low costs solutions to improve productivity and safer work conditions in a recycling cooperative and an ecological bricks factory. This kind of project led her to develop a deep sense of compassion and responsibility to what happens inside very poor communities and the opportunity to see the power of knowledge help when there is space for that. Parallel to it, she started the search for holistic approaches to face the complexity of the problems.  \nIn 2010, Miriam Pinto and a local social entrepreneur led the establishment of Habitat Living Lab, accepted as European Network of Living Labs (Enoll) member since then. \nHabitat Living Lab is a social network which purpose is to improve low-income living conditions based on user-driven open innovation. Two Habitat projects led by Miriam Pinto are:\n1) Mini mobile Factory for recycling civil engineering waste. Involved mechanical, civil and production engineering professors and students from UFES and IFES, two local universities, Technique University of Berlin, Germany; a social enterprise linked to a low-income community and a construction company. \n2) Online platform to connect ideas from people in order to generate collective solutions. Low-income people are the first target public to test the solution and help to improve it. It involves designers, computational engineers from academy and a partner software enterprise, community members, NGOs and local S&T funding agency.\nMiriam Pinto developed negotiation and tolerance abilities as well as network projects management competence with such projects focusing her research on better understanding Living Labs in Brazil and Latin America. \nHabitat Living Lab is showing the value of integrating academic knowledge with popular knowledge. Social and technological innovations are emerging in a very poor urban territory demystifying innovation and bringing together academics and community. \nHabitat’s results are the central motivation to the Master Program in Open and User-drive Innovation this group is proposing.  Such Master Program is the research focal point for specialists in sociology, psychology and philosophy, designers, economists, managers, engineers, architects, urban planners and computer scientists involved with it.', 'Open Science from a Master Program in Open and User-driven Innovation', 'Brazil', 'In Latin America, in general, and in Brazil, specifically, the efforts in Science, Technology & Innovation (STI) have been, since the 1950’s, directed towards catching up central economies. In order to accomplish international relevance, Research & Development (R&D) has been promoted first using linear models adopted by United States and Europe. Then, innovation systems approach became the priority during the 1980’s and 1990’s. Triple Helix proposals of integrative efforts among government, enterprises and academy appeared in 2000’s. \nAlthough STI politics and actions still try to follow central economies, during the last ten years, we started to see alternatives to it. Environmental concerns, social inequalities, water, food and health insecurities promoted the start of something different. \nNowadays it is possible to observe initiatives joining public institutions, enterprises, universities, third sector and society at the same time they connect S&T, culture and arts to solve our challenges. They are open and user-driven innovation proposals.\nOpen Innovation means permeability of innovative organizations to knowledge and other resources. User-driven innovation is a concept that has its origins in Media Lab with William Mitchell, who proposed a user-centric research methodology for sensing, prototyping, validating and refining complex solutions in multiple and evolving real life contexts, called living labs. Living Labs have evolved in Europe mainly centered on enterprises aiming technological innovation. In Latin America, however, initiatives based on open and user-driven innovation are largely led by non-for-profit organizations and oriented towards social innovation and are better called Citizen Labs due to this distinctive orientation .\nMost Citizen Labs are initiatives of universities, NGOs and government; however, they can be led by enterprises. The newness they bring to the scenario of STI is a close relationship between society and researchers. Brazilian experience of Habitat Living Lab (www.labtar.net.br/site/habitat/), Translab (www.translab.cc), Projeto Sossego (www.labgest.com.br) , FPF Tech Amazon Living Lab  (www.fpf.br) indicates that citizen labs are a promising way to connect knowledge and society.\nOur proposal of research is indeed an action-research one. We intend to establish a Professional Master Program in Open and User-Driven Innovation (MOUDI) that will be held by Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo (Ufes) starting in 2015. The Program will bring to life new citizen labs while they become research case studies. Some questions to be answer are: What is the value of citizen labs to local and regional development? In which conditions they succeed and also what kind of success is desired? What are the value, possibilities and ways to incorporate user participation in the innovation process that is concerned with local questions and how they link to world questions? Therefore, our proposition is related to Theme 4: Potential Impacts of Open Science.\nThe core of the program is to provide significant knowledge to graduate students who have a previous desire to change their reality with innovative ideas.  \nBy significant knowledge we mean contents that depart from students previous interests. Guided by such interests, the MOUDI must help the students to reflect and better understand their context, to criticize their ideas, to search for solutions, to format their refined ideas as innovation projects and to find ways to make them come true. \nIn order to accomplish such task, MOUDI is going to be structured around three pillars: \n- Support to deepen students’ understanding of the world at global, national, local and sectorial levels in terms of societal, political, economic, scientific, technical and ethical aspects. \n- Support to generate, explore, test and evaluate innovative ideas using diverse perspectives, models and simulation tools in order to produce feasible projects.\n- Support to make their projects come true. \nThe topics will be delivered in modules. Master students have a minimum workload, however, no module is mandatory and the order to take them is free and guided by  each student’ ideas or projects. \nBesides Master students, people not enrolled in MOUDI can attend the modules and contribute to the ideas and projects in the course. Modules given outside conventional classroom will be welcome. \nGroup work will be promoted by stimulating the coalescence of ideas and projects. Groups of students, organized around ideas or projects, will be mentored by at least two professors. Whenever there is knowledge demand outside permanent group of professors’ expertise, experts will be invited to help. Such design intends to link scientific knowledge to real life demands and also to promote the rapprochement of academic and traditional knowledge. We also expect to stimulate the cross-fertilization of ideas among the areas involved and a rich learning environment for the faculty members.', 'As a heterogeneous group of professors and researchers, our choice is for a holistic approach. \nIn the broadest level of knowledge openness, we consider that there are four ways of reality assessment: science, philosophy, arts and non-rational modes like emotions, intuition and feelings.  However, science has achieved a hegemonic position among them since its connection with the technique to produce technology. Such association brought results and consequences. Its main results were the accelerated development of the machine world and the change produced in man''s relationship with its surroundings. The belief that man can do everything arose. He proposes a situation in which it is the nature that fits his needs and not the other way around. Therefore, everything in nature, including other human beings, becomes resources to be exploited. We are living the consequences of this path globally. Change is mandatory. \nInnovation is mandatory, social and technical innovation. However, we consider that we need to take a step back to see the four ways to get an understanding of reality and stop seeing only science as an option. \nTherefore, MOUDI program makes room for science, technology, philosophy, arts and non-rational studies interact with each other. The ideas brought in to MOUDI will be developed in “citizen labs,” the core study objects in our proposal.  Philosophy, arts and non-rational perspectives will modulate scientific approach. \nIn the broadest investigation level, MOUDI is under the umbrella of action-research and case studies.  Under such umbrella, we intend to organize scientific research in levels. \nThe first one is the society. The theoretical and methodological contributions of social sciences will help the understanding of socioeconomic and cultural dynamics that generate the need for new technologies to answer specific demands from different population segments in various contexts.\nThe combination of multiple procedures for scientific research will unveil macro and micro social processes triggered by the complex interaction between the imperatives of market economy, which is increasingly internationalized, and the local circuits. These last, although impacted by global movements, are typified by their own constitution and unique insertion in the networks of production and circulation of wealth and power. Another vector of reflection and research will be directed to urban dynamics that produces population segmentation creating peripheral areas where equipment, infrastructure and social services are lacking.\nAt micro-social level, research that incorporates dialogue with the actors involved are decisive to ensure the viability of the projects developed within MOUDI facilitating the identification of problems as well as interests, motivations, conflicts and the framework of moral and cultural references of these actors.\nThe second one is the ‘citizen lab’ or entrepreneurial level where the research activity aims to understand how to better organize all the resources necessary to deliver the innovations in mind. Along this perspective, organizational elements such as the best forms of organization, hierarchical or flat, leadership style, remuneration politics, core competencies, information systems and business models adequate to best adjust the ‘citizen lab’ to their environment will be answered. We will also investigate systematic innovation processes at this level. We will use focal groups and surveys, frequently adopted in design, management and production engineering research will be used. \nResearch at individual level is aimed to understand how group affiliations and shared social representations participate on problem-solving skills and abilities. Innovation is taken a result of the action of a situated designer interacting with his physical (phylogenetic level) and social environment (sociogenetic level, which includes the societal and cultural/organizational levels mentioned above). Investigations at the individual level observe people''s ontogenetic development as designers during their lives.\nThe intrapersonal level is focused on understanding the situated designer''s behavior on specific problem-solving contexts and short time scales. Cognitive functioning assessment and behavior analysis are applied to observe how individuals select and use the knowledge built as they interact and design their physical and social environments.\nIn terms of OSCDNet ideals, we believe that our proposal contributes with the possibility of a new dynamic of interaction among the most diverse knowledge areas. It will connect social and human sciences, exact sciences, engineering and business with arts, philosophy and non-rational trends of knowledge in a holistic approach aiming a new way to link academic knowledge to our society and our needs of development. We find that the openness of science we are considering can start to produce sustainable and innovative local environments. \nSuch experience, as a whole, can help other developing regions and nations to find alternative ways to promote their own scientific path.', 'The primary expected outcome from the whole project is the development of a new model to produce social and technological innovation that does not follow the logic of ‘catching up’ and ‘closing the gaps’ relative to the central economies. \nWe expect the production of science and technology guided by our society specificities and moderated by other knowledge perspectives, namely, philosophy, arts and non-rational ones. \nWe live in a world of differences, although, Latin American and African societies can feel it deeper. Our proposition wants to be a contribution to reducing such inequalities and open up more opportunities to produce change. As professors, we believe that knowledge is the most powerful tool against inequalities. \nIn order to accomplish such new dynamics, knowledge will be produced departing from the local reality. The model we are also proposing stimulates the autonomous production of knowledge and innovations connected to local conditions without demanding huge amounts of money or other resources. Indeed, we are dreaming about democratizing innovation, using the expression proposed by Erick von Hippel.\nThe democratization of innovation empowers people, gives them more confidence in their capability to build their future and allows them to establish richer creativity environments for children, youth and adults. \nBesides that, we want to demystify that all innovation has its origins in science. There are other knowledge types able to enhance innovation.   \nThe model also wants to produce a comprehensive understanding that innovation is a social process, even technological innovation, which is built upon subjects’ interaction and that new possibilities in terms of innovation can be accepted and seen as suitable, especially in the realm of social technologies. \nIn terms of OSCDNet, we recognize that we are proposing a different perspective of science openness that can be evaluated as complementary to the common understanding of the concept where the openness is centered on data collection, distribution and use by diverse scientists exploring the potential of Information and Communication Technologies.', 'The monitoring plan consists of keeping track of qualitative and quantitative indicators that demonstrate the results of MOUDI. \n\na) Amount of end-of-course works approved in selected periods and their distribution in relation to graduate students attending MOUDI and the faculty.\n\nb) Applicability of the end-of-course works to companies, public or private bodies, etc. It is important that end-of-course works generate implementation of its results. Such results will be tracked by use of quantitative or qualitative indicators that allows the comparison between "before” and “after".\n\nWe will particularly value disclosure and dissemination of knowledge and innovation resulting from the technical production. \n\nc) Annual average of intellectual production of the program faculty. \nd) Annual production of MOUDI conveyed in books and book chapters.  \ne) Annual production of complete works in annals of events.  \nf) Annual amount of artistic productions, technique, patents, elaboration of protocols, standards or programs; consulting or technical assistance; technical products; prototypes; improvement courses; training or expertise for professionals in the field and other productions considered relevant.\ng) MOUDI impacts:\na.

She received her undergraduate degree in Environmental Studies from Principia College and a Post Baccalaureate Certificate in Statistics from California State University - East bay. Her research focus is on climate change, agriculture, energy, environmental conservation and ICT. Her previous work at ACX ranged from organizing training and capacity building workshops on the Carbon Markets, Climate Change mitigation and adaptation and Energy Efficiency, as well as research on waste management and various aspects of climate change. She is currently carrying out research and implementing projects around Indigenous knowledge and their role in food security and climate change mitigation. She also has ICT research experience from her work with iHub, which include assessing the agricultural extension service landscape in Kenya and the potential role of ICT in expanding extension services to farmers. She also worked on the Open Data in Developing Countries research project sponsored by the World Wide Web Foundation, where she was involved in analyzing the impact of open data applications in increasing access to government data in Kenya. \nShe brings to the team additional skills in Project management, environmental consulting, micro-enterprise development, training and capacity building and her passion to make things work.', 'Low-Tech Carbon Calculator for Smallholder Farmers in Kenya', 'Kenya', 'Climate change is a global threat affecting the overall economic growth of the country. Notably, the adverse impacts of climate change are pervasive and extend to towards various socioeconomic sectors, including agriculture. Agriculture which is one of the most important forms of economic activities globally, is largely governed by climate sensitive resources which dictate the level of productivity of this sector. Agricultural systems, will suffer a high degree of vulnerability and exposure to extreme weather events, climate variability and change; all of which exacerbate the severity of climate impact and place the sector at risk. Increasingly governments, industries, and individuals are becoming aware about the adverse effects of climate change and are concerned about their own impacts on the environment.\n\nPresently Kenya’s agriculture sector contributes approximately 24% of the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (KNBS, Economic Survey, 2012) and is one of the main sources of livelihood and sustenance for a significant proportion of the population. The sector also employs approximately 75% of the country’s labour force either directly or through indirect auxiliary services according to the Kenya Bureau of Statistics 2012 Economic Survey. The adverse impact of climate variability and change on Kenya’s agricultural sector was evident in 2011. The sector suffered a sizable decline in the rate of growth, at 2% in 2011 as compared to a growth rate of 6% in 2010. The low rate of economic growth was attributed primarily to extreme weather events, resulting in reduced agricultural productivity and an increase in operational costs.\n\nAccording to the National Climate Change Action Plan (2012), agriculture is the single biggest contribution to GHG emissions in Kenya with the Livestock sector contributing an estimated 30%. There exists no data to support calculations of GHG emissions in Agriculture despite it being a major economic sector. There is therefore need to develop emission measurements to better understand emission levels in this sector and how to reduce them. Significant reduction in GHG emission in the agriculture sector will lead to major GHG emissions nationwide.  \n\nTo effectively respond to climatic changes in a bid to strengthen the promotion of climate change mitigation measures, we wish to conduct a feasibility study on  the creation and implementation of a low-tech Carbon Calculator Toolkit that can be used by smallholder farmers in any sector to collect data on carbon emission which will populate an open data set that can be used by the Kenya Meteorological Department, other climate change and environmental researchers, policy makers, students and farmers themselves. This data will be used to track Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, water consumption and general resource management which will be useful for a variety of purposes such as policy making, resource management by the farmers, data for research studies and students and by the Meteorological department.\n\nCarbon emission assessment and reduction is emerging as a global agenda to promote climate change mitigation measures. Carbon assessments frameworks can therefore have tremendous effects on Kenya’s Agriculture and how players in this field transact their business and how policies are formulated. Results from the assessment will also be open to the general public, therefore promoting open data in the field of agriculture and climate change. The availability of this data will make it easier for policy makers, private sector and other interested players to design tools that effectively reduce carbon emissions in the sector.\n\nCurrently there exists no standard assessment for carbon emission in Kenya’s agriculture sector. This was one of the reasons Africa in general did not benefit from the carbon market framework which was mainly dependent on energy and manufacturing emission standards from developed countries. The introduction of a carbon emission calculator in the Agriculture sector could potentially lead to the inclusion of more African beneficiaries in the world carbon market.', 'The creation of the toolkit will be preceded by an exploratory study looking into existing data sets on climate change and how the data on these data sets is collected and analyzed as well as with whom it is shared.The exploratory study will involve mixed methods to collect and analyze data. We will conduct semi-structured interviews with selected key stakeholders in the climate change and mitigation sector as well as a survey on small holder farmers.  We will also conduct this exploratory study to discover which kinds of data can be collected from smallholders farmers and which kinds of data policy makers, the meteorological department, climate change and environment researchers need to make their work possible. This discovery will enable us to gain an understanding on which data to aim at collecting from the smallholder farmers that is needed by the stakeholders in the climate change sector. \n\nThe exploratory study will be followed by building a prototype of the low-tech calculator for carbon emissions which will undergo a feasibility study, the focus of the project, to observe how the farmers will interact with the prototype of the calculator. The feasibility study will ask the following questions i) Can the calculator work? ii) Does it work? iii) Will it Work? Further, the feasibility study will focus on the following areas;\ni. Acceptability of the Calculator: Conducting Focus Groups with the target population to determine how the intervention will fit in their daily lives.\nii. Demand for the Calculator: Conducting a survey to establish the likelihood of use of the calculator by the target population.\niii. Implementation: Conducting an examination of the overall efficacy of the calculator in any community other than the target population.\niii. Adaption: Examining the effects of the use of the calculator by the target population.\niv. Integration: Observing and documenting the level of use of the calculator as well as cost and benefit to the users\nv. Expansion: Conducting interviews with key informants to establish perception of how well the calculator will work after wider implementation.\n\nThe calculator will use principles of crowdsourcing information for data gathering on different topics relevant to carbon emission. Data from this calculator will then be shared on an open platform which will be adopted and modified from open source platforms for open data. Further, there will be the creation of an interactive website for visualizing different elements of the data set.', 'In line with the outcomes for the 4th Theme (T4). The  positive expected outcomes include the following: Development of  low tech Carbon Calculator this will enable farmers to key in an punch in relevant information that will be used to calculate carbon and water footprints of smallholder farmers. This collection of data will also assist us in documenting practices observed in farms which can later lead into improved farming practices from monitoring and documenting these activities. Understanding the farming practices as well as improving them will reduce practices that generate high amounts of GHG and thus result in low carbon practices.Data also collected from this can be used to better understand the GHG emissions within the Agriculture sector which can improve access to carbon financing based on accurate carbon emission measurements. Other outcomes include Training farmers to become Carbon literate and to better understand climate change as well as Community engagement in Carbon reduction practices.', 'The key areas of this project are the following:\n1. The Exploratory Study\n2. Creation of the Prototype Calculator\n3. Creation of the Interactive Open Data Platform based on the data set\nWe will use both formative and summative evaluation for this project. \nFor all the three key areas, we will use goal-based evaluation. \n\nExploratory Study: The exploratory study will be a five month phase which will involve literature review to be conducted during the first two months, data collection will be conducted on the third and fourth months and the exploratory report will be prepared and shared with the climate change stakeholders in the fifth month.\n\nCreation of the Prototype Calculator: Findings from the exploratory study will inform the design of the low-tech prototype which will be developed within one month and rolled out to a selected population size which will be selected based on the findings from the exploratory study. This will be followed by a user experience focus group to determine usability of the calculator. This will culminate into rolling out the implementation of the use of the calculator for 10 months. The implementation of the use of this calculator will be preceded by a workshop training for the selected farmers who will use it. A report on the creation of the prototype, the user experience testing and the training workshop  will be prepared and shared with climate change stakeholders before the actual implementation of the use of the calculator.\nCreation of the Interactive Open Data Platform based on the data set: This will be preceded by a report on the findings of the implementation phase, or the feasibility study, which will be share with climate change stakeholders. The creation of the interactive open data platform will accompany the final report of the entire project which will be shared with the public at a seminar and the final report will be also shared with climate change and other relevant stakeholders.', '67,327', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/OCSD_Network_ACX_Endorsement.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSD_Network_ACX_Budget.xlsx', 156, 264, 'complete', 'yes', 1411408038, 'complete', 'Great application, no additional feedback.', '', 45, NULL, 'yes');

The project aims to address four development issues:</p><p>1) Providing engaging and applied education. School enrolment rates as well as quality of education in Kyrgyzstan have regressed considerably since the late 1990s, which is particularly dramatic in remote areas. Curricula that are overly theoretical allow hardly any scope for students to learn through practical and locally adapted teaching methods. Citizen Science has often been named as a suitable tool for introducing applied field teaching into theoretical curricula, enhance student knowledge and involvement with their environment and at the same time contributing to the generation of scientific data. However, to date, very few citizen science projects are being implemented in developing countries.</p><p>2) Access to knowledge and information in remote mountain regions of Kyrgyzstan. Digital information and commons-based knowledge have a great potential to enhance the access to and quality of education in the developing world at relatively low cost. In remote areas of Central Asia however, several challenges exist concerning the adoption and use of openly available knowledge. On the one hand the steep topography and the high centre-periphery gradient in Kyrgyzstan limit the access to Internet and mobile connectivity as well as infrastructure in remote areas, which in turn restricts the adoption and use of information networks. At the same time, little of the presently available information is suitable for the local context, due first of all to severe language restrictions. Indeed, knowledge of English and even Russian is extremely limited in rural areas of Kyrgyzstan, and information resources in Kyrgyz are barely available.</p><p>3) Availability of local level environmental data on mountain regions of Central Asia. While analyses on climate change conclude that Central Asia is exposed to one of the highest rates of adverse effects of climate change, additional challenges have arisen due to decades of mismanagement of natural resources. This includes the overgrazing of pastures, inefficient water and energy management, degradation of soils due to unsustainable agricultural practices, uncontrolled mining, loss of biodiversity and increasing conflicts over natural resources. Although environmental analyses abound for Central Asia in general, there is almost no data available at the local level or that differentiates between ecosystems and altitude levels within the highly diverse Central Asian ecological landscape. Additionally, in order to confront a poor understanding of environmental challenges and awareness of opportunities for change, it is instrumental to introduce locally embedded environmental education to the young generation who will prove primarily responsible for coping with and adapting to a rapidly changing environment.</p><p>4) Promotion of innovative, participatory and open research principles. Participatory and open research still holds a difficult position within the research landscape of Central Asia. Similarly, to date very few citizen science projects are being implemented in countries of the global south, and even less in remote mountain areas, despite the fact that they offer valuable opportunities to combine education and science outcomes if benefits are clearly visible for all participants.</p><p>The KMEECS project proposes to pilot the introduction of local and low cost environmental field courses (one on water monitoring and one on weather and climate) in schools in remote mountain communities of Kyrgyzstan&rsquo;s Naryn province. Based on a citizen science approach, students will analyse and generate data on their local environment, which will be fed into a network of open environmental data. The KMEECS project involves a varied set of stakeholders (Non-governmental organizations, Universities, local and national governmental institutions, rural schools and communities) and fits very well within T3 Communities of Practice, with strong linkages to T4 Potential impacts of OCS.</p><p>The aim of the study will be to pilot the abovementioned project and to provide a thorough analysis of all involved stakeholders (embedded in their institutional setting) and their interests in adopting OCS approaches. Research questions: Who are the (expected and unexpected) stakeholders involved in and influenced by the introduction of a practical environmental education curriculum based on citizen science in remote mountain schools and how do they relate to each other? - Which institutions and groups of participants are involved and what are their roles, interests and resources? - Who is not or has no interest in being involved? - What are the interactions and relationships between stakeholders? - How are they positively and/or negatively impacted by the KMEECS project?</p>', '<p>Based on an inherently applied project design, this research will be conducted as a case study and employs a participatory action research framework. Research findings will be produced all along the implementation of the citizen science and environmental education project. The methodological steps for the implementation of the KMEECS project will include:</p><p>- Content analysis of biology, geography, environmental science curricula in Kyrgyzstan.</p><p>- Analysis of existing environmental data and platforms (local, regional, global) for sharing open environmental data</p><p>- Participatory development of a locally adapted curriculum for citizen science based field teaching, with contributions from CAMP Alatoo, UCA, active local teachers, members of the Ministry for Education, partner organizations working on the integration of traditional environmental knowledge into development and education projects</p><p>- Development of a Teacher&rsquo;s training manual for capacity-building and as a field guide for teachers implementing citizen science activities</p><p>- Composition of resource boxes for each school conducting the field activities</p><p>- Elaboration of a simple tool for management of collected data via tablets and mobile phones (in collaboration with the Mountain-EVO project, see below)</p><p>- Select 30 schools, which are well distributed across the 5 regions within Naryn province, contact teachers and present the pilot project - Select 15 pilot schools upon reception of a motivation letter from interested teachers</p><p>- Training of teachers on the integration of citizen science based field activities into their teaching</p><p>- Installation of two small automatic weather stations for validation of collected data (these two weather stations will complement a network of other weather stations planned within partner environmental projects, such as Mountain-EVO, see below)</p><p>- Monitoring of implementation and data collection in schools (see M&amp;E section) - Integration of collected data into existing as well as project/partner created data pools and geographic visualization - Data analysis and feedback to communities</p><p>- Evaluation of the KMEECS pilot, publication of results Action research will be used to develop reflective accounts of the project outcomes and the roles, involvement and potential to advocate OCSD that all the concerned and involved stakeholders and institutions have played.

There are several previous and parallel projects and methodologies, which will greatly complement and contribute to this initiative.</p><p>Firstly CAMP Alatoo provides a profound background on Learning for Sustainability, local environmental knowledge and environmental awareness raising, which will be incorporated into curriculum and training activities. CAMP Alatoo has tested a new Learning for Sustainability module this year, where an imitation game to raise awareness about conflicts over natural resources was adapted for school children in rural areas of Kyrgyzstan.</p><p>A previous project implemented by the University of Central Asia addressed the lack of access to knowledge and information in remote mountain communities by introducing an offline database of locally relevant resources operated as a mobile digital library in a refurbished minivan. These previous experiences will be available for the present initiative and the mobile library vehicle will be used for the outreach and M&amp;E activities to be conducted in the villages, making available its database to local villagers at the same time. In its next project phase the mobile digital library will also be involved in environmental education and will host a mobile interactive exhibition on climate change, visiting remote mountain communities.</p><p>Further, UCA implements the Mountain-EVO project for Kyrgyzstan on Environmental Virtual Observatories for mountain environmental services and poverty alleviation, which will install 4 complementary regional weather stations and develop a web-based as well as offline tablet-based application for data management.</p><p>The data collected through a combined citizen science and environmental education approach will be integrated into local, regional and global environmental data pools and integrated e.g. with open climate data available from other development and research projects operating weather stations in the Naryn region (e.g. open weather map, or with water analyses conducted by researchers and industrial companies). This combination of data sources allows a validation of the collected data as well as its publication within the framework of other projects and thus an increased outreach and networking opportunity.</p><p>The data will also be used in the Central Asian Atlas project starting this year at UCA, within which possibilities for generating meaningful and simple visualized feedback information for the local level will also be explored. All generated datasets, curricula, teaching resources, research outputs and documentations will be made available under a creative commons license.</p>', '<p>The outcomes of the proposed KMEECS project are expected to contribute to different development as well as research goals. As mentioned above in the addressed development issues, the project will contribute to</p><p>1) Provision of engaging and applied education and improved access to knowledge and information in marginalized mountain regions of Kyrgyzstan: Educational research shows that people have greater motivation to engage and learn if the subject is directly relevant to their lives, environment and interests and if the learning process is interactive. Therefore this project will produce valuable outcomes for fostering environmental education in Kyrgyzstan in the form of a locally adapted curriculum, which fits into the teaching plans, involves a citizen science approach and includes traditional ecological knowledge. As it will be developed in accordance with the Ministry of Education, upon successful piloting the curriculum can inform country-wide educational policies in Kyrgyzstan and promote a transit towards more applied and interactive education methods across the Kyrgyz Republic.</p><p>2) Availability of local level environmental data on mountain regions of Central Asia: Through the generation of citizen science data and its linkage to other ongoing initiatives collecting local environmental data, the project contributes to filling climate and environmental data gaps on the local level by integrating the collected data into existing platforms and networks.</p><p>3) Promotion of innovative, participatory and open research principles: Today&rsquo;s youth will hold a great responsibility in the sustainable management of their environment as well as their communities. Early exposure to and involvement in open and collaborative processes will strengthen students&rsquo; perceptions of themselves as active stakeholders in understanding and shaping their local environment. Linking up with other students across Naryn province and possibly in other parts of the world through their involvement in a network will further encourage the students to think across boundaries.</p><p>Starting from 2016 the University of Central Asia will also offer BSc in Earth and Environmental Science to be taught at its decentralized campus for Central Asian mountain regions. Raising awareness about environmental questions and involving students in science also has the potential to foster interest among rural school children in taking up environmental studies. Apart from this, the project will also advocate the principles of OCS for Development among other involved stakeholders, such as government officials and scholars who do not yet implement participatory and open research, nor value its methods and data. Especially in environmental sciences the active contribution of community members and non-researchers is not yet seen as a valid source of data, although it can greatly increase the reach and understanding of research among the population of countries in the global south.</p><p>Based on the case study, the outcomes of the analysis of involved stakeholders and institutions will provide evidence how these stakeholders interact and engage in OCSD. It is expected that the analysis will generate valuable understanding of potential leaders of future open and collaborative science, their motivations, and the resources at their disposal to advance such future OCSD efforts.</p>', '<p>The proposed concept note consists of the implementation of a pilot project and of an analysis of the stakeholders and institutions involved in the pilot project. Based on the action research methodology, Monitoring and Evaluation will be conducted along the workplan, whenever steps towards an outcome are being implemented. The pilot project activities will be monitored regularly by providing updates on conducted activities, evolution of the curriculum development process, locations of the selected pilot schools, participants in teacher training seminars, reports from field work, documentation of the work with children, feedback from participants, nature of collected data, arising challenges etc.</p><p>This will be done using the online platforms used for sharing progress within the OCSD Network, but additionally a focus will also be laid on social media and communication of results in local languages, since these are more commonly used in Kyrgyzstan. Further, quantitative indicators such as number of trained teachers, number of children participating in field classes, availability of curriculum and teacher&rsquo;s manual, amount of collected data, number of channels for publishing citizen science data will also be gathered. After the finalization of the curriculum the document will go through a broad review process, which will also provide an evaluation of the work conducted.</p><p>At the end of the project an external evaluation will analyse the results of the pilot project in the field and give advise on how this experience should be handled in future, as well as if it has the potential to be replicated. An open question regarding monitoring is the empirical validity of the data collected through citizen science in schools. It will be attempted to be tackled through this project, through regular participation in school field activities and comparison with automatically generated data. Although this is a highly important issue, it will not be in the focus of the present project, since it will become especially relevant on a time scale exceeding the two years of the present project. However, the question of validity will be addressed in cooperation with partners working on the same topic and inputs on this topic could be extremely valuable from within the OCSD Network, as it is expected that other projects will be focusing their research on areas relevant to validation of OCS data.</p>', '75''200 CAD', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/2014_09_CAMP_Alatoo2.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudget-Kyrgyzstan_CAMP-Alatoo_UCA.xlsx', 192, 254, 'complete', 'yes', 1411424754, 'complete', '', '', 40, 'yes', NULL),

He has over 8 years professional experience in energy access, energy sector governance and low-carbon innovation. He has also worked on gender issues related to science, technology and innovation. Oliver has been employed across the globe by a diverse range of organisations, including international organisations, national governments, community-based NGOs, development policy think tanks and academic institutions. \n\nOliver’s research interests lie in understanding complexities associated with transitioning to sustainable and inclusive energy systems. In particular, he works on systems approaches to inclusion of marginalised communities in innovation processes, focusing on infrastructures, markets, government policies and regulation, user practices, social norms and cultural meaning.\n\nPrior to joining SEI, Oliver worked for the German Development Institute (DIE) in Bonn and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in Geneva. He has a PhD in Science and Technology Policy Studies from SPRU (Science & Technology Policy Research) at University of Sussex. His doctoral work focused on power, ownership and knowledge in electricity reform in Ghana and Tanzania. He also has an MA in International Studies from University Leeds and a BSc (Hons) in Physics from University of Nottingham.\n\nOliver has substantial experience leading and working on projects relevant to this study. For example: \n\n- Principal researcher on IDRC-funded project on developing a framework for participatory energy planning in Kenyan counties: facilitating citizen’s engagement in energy planning through participatory stakeholder mapping exercises, community meetings and household surveys in order to ensure development of the local energy system meets local needs, improves energy access and is sustainable in the long-run.\n\n- Co-principal reseacher on SEI initiative on behaviour and choice: developing tools and methods to understand the needs, perspectives and decision-making processes of individuals and households (users) in order to improve the effectiveness of interventions aimed at changing behaviour. \n\n- Co-principal researcher on UNEP-funded project on developing a toolkit to operationalize the green economy transition: Developing tools to help sub-national communities better align local economic development strategies with environmental interests so that swifter progress can be made toward national green economy goals. \n\n- Research collaborator on Sida-funded project on the food, energy and environment nexus in Ethiopia: facilitated stakeholder engagement and coordinated participatory energy scenario modeling to co-produce knowledge on the impacts of different development trajectories on food and energy production, as well as local livelihoods and environmental impacts.\n\nTo complement the expertise of the principal researcher, the research collaborators on this team bring substantial local and regional knowledge, as well as high levels of expertise in participatory and collaborative methodologies. Furthermore, the collaborator from Practical Action, John Masai, brings with him significant expertise on action research. Practical Action work has always entailed participatory approaches, working together with communities to adopt a collaborative approach to development and knowledge sharing.', 'The potential for open and collaborative knowledge generation for county-level energy planning in Kenya', 'Kenya', 'Under the auspices of Theme 4 of OCSDNet – Potential impacts of Open and Collaborative Science – this study will explore the quality, meaningfulness and possible utility of citizen engagement in energy sector decision-making in Kenyan counties. In doing so, it will also touch upon Theme 2 of OCSDNet – Infrastructures and Technologies – by identifying the extent to which mobile and internet technologies are feasible methods of empowering marginalised communities, given the limited access they might have to such technologies.\n\nKenya has recently established a devolved government system that provides for people’s participation in matters that affect them. In the energy sector, devolution (also referred to as decentralisation) offers an opportunity to redress past imbalances created by the centralised approach to planning, such as prioritisation of large energy systems and neglect of the biomass sector. For example, like in many other Sub Saharan African countries, decision makers in Kenya’s energy sector have tended to prioritize large industrial energy needs, often neglecting the household sector, even though it accounts for 68% of the country’s energy demand. Limited access to modern energy services means that most household energy needs are met through traditional biomass fuels, which are associated with serious indoor air pollution, environmental degradation and negative social impacts.\n\nHowever, devolution is not guaranteed to lead to more locally appropriate energy planning, especially where clear pathways have not been established, tested and customized according to needs. In theory, bringing government closer to the governed in both the spatial and institutional senses, allows government to better understand and respond to the needs of the people. Yet if, in practice, pathways in implementing devolution policies are unclear, policies governing resources distribution are weak and planning remains tightly controlled by local authorities with little participation of the community, understanding of local needs may remain limited and responses may simply advance the interests of entrenched institutions while ignoring alternative pathways and solutions and failing to empower local communities and marginalized groups. \n\nDespite constitutional legislation in Kenya, avenues to make energy planning work at local levels is still a grey area. This research aims to explore mechanisms through which citizens can successfully engage in the design, implementation and adoption of energy policy, technologies and services. Open and Collaborative Science approaches offer an opportunity to engage citizens in new and innovative ways, which in some cases may serve to bypass traditional bottlenecks, such as limited manpower, weak feedback mechanisms, poor infrastructure and entrenched patterns of activity. \n\nThe proposed study would extend and deepen current efforts by SEI and Practical Action to develop a framework for participatory energy planning in Kenyan counties. In particular, it would add significant value by using a combination of participation observation, action research and capacity building within communities to analyse the extent to which such open and collaborative processes are a practical and appropriate way of improving energy planning at county level. \n\nThe research question driving the study is: How can open and collaborative knowledge generation improve energy planning in Kenyan counties?\n\nSub-research questions include:\n1. What methods and technologies are feasible and effective in collaborative knowledge generation for energy planning?\n2. To what extent does collaborative knowledge generation encourage alternative and marginalised voices in the energy planning process?\n3. How does collaborative knowledge generation influence (positively and negatively) the energy planning process? \n\nThe insights from this research will be of significant relevance to other sectors and other counties in Kenya, as well as to other developing countries. It will help illuminate the benefits and challenges associated with open, collaborative and deliberative knowledge generation processes, including how that knowledge then gets put into practice. The project will provide key lessons for the impact of collaborative knowledge generation on both the process and outcome of decision-making, as well as the resultant (re)distribution of resources. This research will provide synergistic outputs by adding more depth and a real long-term focus on the existing project, and will therefore provide significant added value.', 'The research will be conducted in Migori County where the framework was developed and in another County with a different energy resource portfolio. It will both extend and deepen the current research, including employing mobile technologies. The research will take place over two years and will be split into three work packages:\n\nWork Package 1: Preparation (6 months)\nFramework finalization, citizen mobilization, clarification of openness and collaboration – setting of indicators. Development of a robust mixed method approach, which will likely include: traditional focus group discussions and household surveys, participatory scenario development, mobile phone information gathering and dissemination, citizen scientist engagement (such as the potential inclusion of school science teams), and a participatory planning kit that may include LEAP and participatory GIS.\n\nWork Package 2: Piloting (1 year)\nHaving developed indicators and identified open and collaborative mixed methods to apply the framework, we will implement the pilot study. \n\nWork Package 3: Feedback and reflections (2 years)\nIn tandem with WP2, there will be a series of workshops to share insights from the implementation process and assess its impact in energy planning. The information and feedback generated from this will be used to examine the effectiveness of the framework in delivering energy services to the communities.\n\nThe design and methods to be used in the research reflect the ideals of OCSDNet in multiple ways: from opening up the energy planning process through inclusive agenda-setting, data generation and data analysis, to wide dissemination and use of the collaborative knowledge generated, with the aid of various emerging social platforms and tools. By employing digital tools, where possible, the research will also contribute to a greater understanding of the usefulness of these tools, not just in the planning process but also in limiting the exclusion of marginalised individuals and groups within the affected communities.', 'The outcomes of this research are expected to be three-fold, namely: \n\n1. To provide a clear demonstration of open technologies and tools that can be useful and applied in counties’ participatory energy planning processes. This will be communicated through and reflected upon in workshops as outlined in WP3, and will seek to encourage public engagement.\n2. To deliver clear pathways and approaches in the area of participatory energy planning and identify key strengths and weaknesses of the application of an OCS approach in public sector planning. This will be communicated through the refined framework, and the limitations and benefits shared by the stakeholders through different avenues established during project implementation. Evidence will be generated and shared with practitioners and the scientific world on the limitations and or usefulness of application of OCS in participatory energy planning.\n3. To effectively and inclusively deliver and implement an enhanced framework for public energy planning, with a view to improving the provision of energy services to communities and strengthening future public planning processes. \n\nThe main outcome of this research will be to bring new insights to the effectiveness and impacts of participatory planning in the public sector. The project will identify key strengths and weaknesses of an OCSD approach in public sector planning, and will inform the future trajectory of OCSD, in the energy sector and elsewhere. Ultimately the project is expected to improve the energy planning process at county level by applying both tested and innovative ways to actively involve communities in the planning and delivery of services in the energy sector. Though this project will be focussed on the energy sector, the participatory methodologies are expected to have a wide applicability, and could be tested and implemented in other public sectors planning process. In the long-run, the research aims to contribute to the improved delivery of energy services, particularly to poor and marginalised communities.', 'Monitoring and evaluation will be based on the theory of change approach through application of SEI’s Planning, Monitoring, Evaluation and Communication system &#40;PMEC&#41;. This approach allows project impacts to be observed beyond project activities and outputs. The monitoring and evaluation approach used for this project will look at the changes the project has contributed to and the stakeholders directly influenced by the project. The tool assists the project team to focus on the foreseen outcomes and be realistic about the impact and contribution they can make towards knowledge generation in the use of OCS in participatory energy planning. It promotes adaptive management of project activities and outputs: by allowing project teams to track the outcomes of their work and make adjustments if they do not see the desired progress. \n\nThe results chain is as follows:\n\nActivities: \n- Research and establish indicators for participatory planning;\n- Draw up the methodology of data collection;\n- Establish a refined framework for participation after piloting; and\n- Identify stakeholders and their participation platforms.\n\nOutputs: \n- Tested and refined framework;\n- Tested indicators;\n- Developed and applied methodologies for participation in county-level planning; and\n- Stakeholder workshops.\n\nOutcomes: \n- To give a clear documentation and guide on how OCS can deliver inclusive and effective energy planning;\n- To provide evidence to practitioners and scientific world on the limitations and or usefulness of application of OCS in participatory energy planning;\n- To give communities and county government guidance in improving community participation and information on applicable methodologies; and\n- To strengthen the participatory planning process, and its monitoring and analysis.', '79,970 CAD', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/Letter_of_Endorsement_SEI-PA.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudget_SEI-PA_Final1.xlsx', 51, 264, 'complete', 'yes', 1411409605, 'complete', 'A very good proposal.

As consultant as public health research methodologist and research ethics have found the essential need of the openness in research in public health. This experience has led to this application.', 'Is research based on open access demographic health survey being published in open access journals? Why are sub-set of researchers publishing research based on open access data in non-open access journals ?', 'India, Bangladesh,Brazil,Mexico,Egypt, Yemen,South Africa, Kenya', 'Open access and collaborative science is considered as cornerstone to human development. Research in public health is a ‘public good’ and hence entire research process requires to follow principles of open access and collaborative science. Demographic and health surveys (DHS) provide free of cost, ready to use data for over 90 countries from 300 surveys.  DHS are nationally-representative household surveys that provide data for a wide range of monitoring and impact evaluation indicators in the areas of population, health, and nutrition.\nDHS data is collected by house to house field surveys conducted by trained field researchers. DHS survey process sometimes involves collection of biological samples and always involves measurement of anthropometry of women and children. The entire process involves voluntary participation of large number of people and communities in an open and collaborative process. \n\nThe collected and processed DHS data is available under an open access platform to researchers for analysis around the globe. This service is provided by United State Agency for International Development. Also, some countries do provide national and sub-national data through respective channels. Over the years, research on DHS data has covered wide range of topics ranging from secular trend analysis for a region to comparative studies of health indicators between countries. Researchers have analysed disease burden, mortality indicators, population nutritional indicators, maternal and child health status of populations. DHS data has also been used to measure health service coverage and resource distribution across geography, gender, socio-economic status in several countries. \n\nOver time, DHS in several countries has been capturing more data thus enabling advanced analysis by researchers. For example in India, the first DHS documented nine population characteristics while the third DHS documented 29 population characteristics.  Furthermore, since DHS provides population representative data, researchers have been able to produce papers having impact on public policy. \n\nOpen access of DHS has undoubtedly contributed to volume and quality of research generated in public health. However we believe that the impact of open access DHS on policy change and development may be limited by the fact that not all studies based on DHS data are published in open access journals. This belief stems from the understanding that open access publication being part of open science practise is an enabler of development and policy change. Thus increased publication of DHS data based research in open access journals is imperative for development. The proposed research concept dwells around publication of research papers based on DHS data. \n\nIt is hypothesised that a researcher is bound to publish research conducted on ‘open access’ data in an ‘open access’ journal due to following reasons;\n\n1. The purpose of DHS is to provide population level data for monitoring and evaluation of population health leading to policy change. Hence analysis published should be accessible to public ‘freely’ to facilitate better development and policy change\n2. The data used for research is publically funded ‘open source’ data and is gathered through open voluntary community participation. Hence the researcher is ethically bound make the research a ‘public good’. \n\nThe proposed research study is based on an assumption that “Not all research based on DHS data is published in open access journal”. This statement stems from research team’s experience in public health research till date. We also take cognisance of the fact that researchers could have reasons for choosing to publish their work in a paid access journal. Hence we propose to structure the study in two phases. Firstly we propose to quantify and stratify sample DHS data based research published in open access and paid access journals. Further, we propose to explore plausible motivation of sample researchers to publish their DHS based research in open access and paid access journals. \n\nThis study proposes to quantify DHS based research published in open access and paid access journals form a sample of countries. Further it seeks to understand why sub samples of researchers choose an open access or paid access journal to publish their work. The objective of the study is to generate evidence so as to advocate and enabling environment for open access publication of research based on public funded open access data.', 'The proposed study has two phases. Research Objective and methods to be adopted in each phase are outlined in  below\n\nPhase 1- Objective: To quantify and stratify DHS data based research published from sample countries in open access and paid access journals.\nMethods: Review of literature. Papers will be retrieved from health and social science data bases. Papers will then be classified based on open access or paid access journals. Further stratification and analysis will be done based on journal indexing and impact factor\n \nPhase 2- What was the motivation for the researcher to publish the work in open/paid access journal ? \nMethods: This will be a qualitative study. A semi-structure questionnaire will be sent to a stratified representative sample of researchers. Questions will be framed so as to understand their motivations.  Answers will be analysed through ‘Qualitative Content Analysis’ method', 'C.5 Expected Development-related Outcomes and Relevance\n\nThe proposed research study addresses theme 1 and 4. The study is based on hypotheses that research data generated through an open science collaborative process available as a public good is to be analysed and published in an open access journal. This study would provide quantitative evidence for quantum of research published in open access journals, which is based on open access data. The study would also provide an understanding of why researchers choose to or choose not to publish research in open access journals when their data is collected through an open access process. A quantitative evidence and process understanding would be valuable tools for advocates in furthering an open access publishing environment. Creating such an environment is imperative to development and policy change. Also, DHS data collection is a result of a publically funded open community participatory process. Hence researchers are ethically bound to publish research based on DHS data in open access journals.

We have sufficient expertise to complete this research study', 'Insufficient research integrity enablers may negatively influence the public health professionals in India to practice the open and collaborative research', 'India', 'To the extent that studies are done scientifically and marketed honestly, they contribute greatly to the general lawfulness and openness to change that characterizes the global north. Societal dependence on science conveys on scientists a great ethical responsibility to conduct research with integrity. \nResearch integrity can be referred as active adherence to the ethical principles and professional standards essential for the responsible practice of research. While science or research encourages vigorous defense of one''s ideas and work, ultimately research integrity means examining the data with objectivity and being guided by the results rather than by preconceived notions. One of the important elements of the research is the collegiality in scientific interactions, communications and sharing of resources between and within. The openness and collaborative access or platform in cross-national, cross-disciplinary and cross-sector partnerships is an essential for a public health research as the health or disease has no borders or barriers between the people across the world.  Health is a basic right of the individual.\nHence the improving or policies of the research integrity enablers at individual and systemic levels is an important contribution in global north public health research.  Due to this systemic research integrity contribution, the global south community is benefitting from their research in public health. \nSociety gives researchers a great deal of autonomy in conducting their professional lives which help them to contribute to society by research. When self-regulation fails to sustain honesty and high quality, society imposes rules and laws to maintain its interests in professional quality. \nProfessionalism at the individual level and research integrity policies at various levels (institution or state) is an important factor that factors that favors the public health researchers to more interactive with the society, sharing for scientific deliberations etc which together can be openness or collaborative research. \nIn India, for example, substantial talent is increasingly being tapped internationally, and systems have not been developed there to optimally use this talent for long term societal development. Thus India has brilliant basic scientists and clinicians but a poorly developed public health research and teaching system that lacks originality and substance and prevents fundamental improvements in population health. Currently, no coherent agenda exists for original and relevant research in the core disciplines of public health or in major visible public health problems in India. Without substantial original research, teaching in public health is not surprisingly bland and theoretical. Good-quality public health research output from India is grossly inadequate, and strategic planning to improve it is necessary if substantial enhancement of population health were to be made possible. Lack of the systemic integrity for research at the individual and institutional level may be factors that can be attributed about the decreasing public health research in open and collaborating. Cross sharing  of the ideas, concepts is essential for public  health since it is multidisciplinary approach which may place the researches to limit to open sharing platform due to lack of support in case of misconduct in sharing.  \n Public health research is essentially as multidiscipline approach, there needs to be openness and collaborative platform. It would provide the platform from which to launch dedicated efforts to address major diseases and health conditions that burden low-income or middle income populations like India. \nWe attribute that unlike in global north the Indian public health researchers face substantial factors to individual and systemic factors.

His field of expertise and research specialisation is social sciences and humanities, with the focus on african development, comparative studies, development studies, environmental studies, information technology and socio-economic development, international political economy.', '   Tackling Climate Change; Open Science and Solutions for Africa', 'South Africa, Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, Mozambique, Zimbabwe', 'Climate change is threatening the economies and livelihoods of many African countries.  According to a recent study, parts of Sudan and Ethiopia; the countries surrounding Lake Victoria in central Africa; and the continent’s south-eastern corner, especially parts of South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe are under serious threat of climate variability and change.  Climate variability and change will have serious and adverse consequences for these countries adding significantly to the development challenges.\nEven though the solar, wind, biomass and other energy and environmental technologies have not generally been patented in most of these countries, adequate access to climate change technology is still a major challenge. The lack of patents filed for climate change technologies in Africa means these technologies can be freely exploited in Africa. This presents a window of opportunity for ‘made in Africa’ solutions.\nInstead of focusing on immediate technology transfer solutions, African countries need a medium-to-long term strategy for tackling climate change.  There are vast areas of technology where innovation is needed to serve African needs and demand. National innovation systems should prioritize climate change research and innovation in Africa by African scientists. \nNot only European or American researchers, but researchers all around the world are currently conducting scientific research that focuses on the most important frontiers of climate change. No matter whether it is Johannesburg, Addis Abba, Harare or Kampala, universities everywhere are capable of creating, discovering and inventing. Invention can be achieved in any university research laboratory. Nevertheless, taking this research out of laboratory and sharing the scientific findings with other researchers is a real challenge, particularly for Africa.\nThere is a need for creative frameworks aimed at enhancing the synergy between researchers, universities and industry. Indeed, a well-functioning system largely depends on the existence of a balanced social and institutional framework, which is accompanied by certain safeguards. This entails priority setting and careful assessment of the scientific research environment. It also requires an in-depth analysis of academic culture and structures, including the encouragement of open science approaches. Despite all the difficulties in Africa, the opportunity still exists to create an open and collaborative environment that can foster and enrich links and resources. Climate science can truly benefit by being more firmly grounded in the principles of openness.\n\nOpen Science approaches can guide research community and policy makers towards right solutions. Effective adaptation and mitigation strategies require information on the local impact of climate change, and climate projections need to be downscaled to finer resolutions. African countries are projected to face the greatest human impact from climate change. In order to empower stakeholders, keep them informed and motivated by the research process, a successful strategy should aim to develop new methods for doing research and for communicating results.\nAfrica will benefit most from new generation of researchers who will take an open science approach to interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary research on climate change technologies. In order to achieve this, Africa needs to explore completely new approaches to the problem; to take different tacks from the business-as-usual approach based on complex climate models. An African network can be set up to develop and share scientific research and knowledge to establish mitigation policies, and to develop adaptation and risk management strategies. Researchers can join these network and engage in south–south and African – African collaborations as a way to gain economies of scale and participate in larger regional innovation strategy.  \nTo this end, this research aims to illustrate the crucial role that open science strategies might play within processes of climate variability and change. The study draws on case studies of best practices of open science research in climate change and the extent to which the lessons learned from these case studies are useful and to what degree they are transferable to the current policies regarding climate change in Africa.', 'The research combines both theoretical and empirical data. The theoretical data involves the relevant political and economic literature as well as legislation. It also includes reports from international organizations, non-governmental organizations, interest groups, and news items. The theoretical framework employs a structural business analysis of social, legal, economic, political and technological factors (known as SLEPT analysis). The SLEPT analysis provides a range of useful concepts to gain a better understanding of complex interplay between open science initiatives and climate change studies as well as social, cultural and policy frameworks. Throughout the study, further references will be made to these factors in order to emphasize the importance of these factors in constructing an open and collaborative framework for climate variability and change.\nQualitative and quantitative research designs will be adopted to provide descriptive, interpretive and empirical data. The arguments and recommendations will be drawn from social, economic, technical and political traits and will be designed to illustrate the manner in which open science initiatives can be utilized for development of climate variation and technologies in Africa.', 'Considering the successful stories driven from open science initiatives all around the world, it can be suggested that African countries need to create synergy to assure the optimum use and allocation of resources and promotion of open science and collaboration for tackling with climate change. The accomplishment of these goals requires societal and organizational changes encouraging openness, trust, reliance, cooperation and interdependence in the research community. Important lessons can be drawn from open science initiatives. Re-organization around the common goals – that is climate variability and change, and working principles, institutional cooperation and creation of a common but open culture for innovation will bring about what African countries need; solid African solutions for climate change.\nThe research findings aim to contribute significantly to the body of knowledge in relation to new developmental policies. Overall, it is hoped that these findings can promote open science solutions for Africa and ensure the sustainability of climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.', 'Improved understanding of climate variability and change requires cooperation across different disciplines. The complex nature of Earth’s climate system entails a holistic approach to its study, however the disciplinary nature of some of the scientific challenges and existing organizational arrangements should also be considered in order to build an infrastructure that would advance scientific knowledge. Therefore, a combination of a grassroots disciplinary approach together with strategically focused holistic priorities will be considered.\nThe first phase of the research will involve a study through literature of climate variability and change, necessary technologies challenges for Africa as well as open science initiatives. The second phase will build on successful case studies of open science, as it will provide an insight into initiatives and challenges faced by policy makers and seek the eligibility of these initiatives climate change solutions in Africa.\nThe next step is dedicated to an analysis phase, which includes a field work for identification of the main actors in the field of climate variability and change in Africa and their behaviors and interactions at multiple levels. This phase requires a survey (structured interviews in person and by phone as well as a questionnaire).\nAt the final stage, eligibility of the open science initiatives for climate change solutions in Africa will be identified. Therefore, at the end of research, it is expected to come out with a set of evaluated tools developing a social, cultural and policy framework for open science solutions in climate variability and change. The tools and a model will illustrate the conceptual advances made within the open science initiatives as well as providing an eligibility of it for certain African countries tackling climate change.', '78,971', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/Letter_of_Endorsement_Dr_Burcu_Kilic.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudgetTemplate45.xlsx', 142, 260, 'complete', 'yes', 1411160298, 'complete', '', '', 30, NULL, 'yes'),

The knowledge and skills gained while assessing the research and development strategies by both institutions forms an essential basis for a more critical engagement with and interrogation of open and collaborative research networks and how these impact on community development in terms of actual changes noticeable in the livelihoods of the community.\nI have successfully conducted (and in some respects published) several researches and articles, both as individual and/or as member of a team (as in the list above) all of which have enabled me to gains hands-on knowledge in both academic and development research projects. Apart from the above listed research products, I have been part of the consulting team in conducting baseline surveys, mid-term reviews and end of project or impact evaluation. I was for instance involved in the evaluation of different projects by Plan International: the mid-term review and impact evaluation of Breaking the Silence on HIV-AIDS; baseline, midterm and impact evaluation of Scaling-up the Awareness on HIV-AIDS; and impact evaluation of Prevention of Mother-to-Child (PMTCT). Recently, I was part of the team that evaluated OXFAM’s theory of change in the context of its partners’ influencing role on land rights and gender issues in post-war northern Uganda. \nMost of these interventions include active engagement of the beneficiary communities in the design of intervention strategies, monitoring of implementation and evaluation of effects. The most relevant for open and collaborative science is the UMU-UND research and community development initiatives that directly marry both theoretical/academic and action research with practical development work that seeks to elicit real transformation of livelihoods. With adequate awareness of their interventions, this research will provide an added opportunity of establish the extent to which their approaches have been open to community participation, how the sharing of knowledge enhances the synergies among the various stakeholders, and how that openness informs the research process and benefits community in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, positive impact and sustainability of such interventions.', 'The nexus between research-informed development, community participation and sustainable livelihoods', 'Uganda, United States', 'There has been widespread criticism of livelihood improvement initiatives in recent years. Apart from disappointing results, livelihood improvement initiatives are said to be predominantly top-down and outsider-influenced, hence the need for them to be more bottom-up and locally-oriented. Many development programmes in developing countries have in recent decades had minimal success, largely due to lack of sufficient community participation in the design, implementation and management of livelihood transformation initiatives (World Bank 2002).  Over-centralization of decision making by the development actors has remained a core constraint in fostering community participation, especially among the rural people, hence creating a communication gap between the beneficiaries and the development actors. In view of this deficit, many development programmes and projects by state and non-state actors are being designed and implemented using participatory approaches with the view to bringing the disparate community voices into the development process. \nBut there is growing consensus among development researchers and practitioners that livelihood improvement initiatives should involve more participation of beneficiaries at all levels of project cycle. Without active participation of the beneficiaries, livelihood transformation initiatives often falter in terms of relevancy, impact and sustainability. While participatory processes for development are being adopted, concerns abound as to the level and quality of participation in influencing analysis of their problems and designing of future and sustainable solutions. There is underlying trepidation as to whether ineffective participation may not merely rubberstamp what is essentially a top-down approach, with donor interests and over-reliance on foreign experts taking toll on the focus and orientation of such initiatives. \nCommunity participation entails maximization of people’s involvement in all the stages of development. As a process of giving communities opportunity to determine their own destination in terms of their needs and resources, participation must allow the people to influence development and policy decisions and to freely express themselves so as to develop their full potential in areas of their own choice. Community participation should move beyond its narrow definition as the mobilization of people to contribute free labour and materials, to more extensive interpretations as a process of empowering people and giving them authority to own, direct and control programmes. To bring about effective social change, inclusion of people in development projects should be promoted as the surest way to guaranteeing relevancy, effectiveness and sustainability of livelihood initiatives. \nIn Uganda, various poverty reduction programs and initiatives have elicited remarkable significance in the use of the community participatory approach as a means of facilitating and accelerating the process of rural development, although this has remained more in policy documents than in practice. Both government and non-governmental organizations have embraced community participation to enhance rural development. Seeking to contribute to the national and international efforts in improving the plight and livelihoods of the rural poor in Uganda, Uganda Martyrs University (UMU) in partnership with the University of Notre Dame (UND) in the USA, implemented a community-driven development program in Nnindye community in Mpigi District. This program, named the University Partnership for Outreach Research and Development (UPFORD), aims at helping the residents of Nnindye to achieve meaningful and sustainable social and economic development, and to demonstrate that even poor communities can plan, implement and manage interventions required to achieve sustainable livelihoods. \nHowever, there are growing concerns that Universities cannot afford to operate as nongovernmental organization in funding development initiatives, hence a call to them to retain the role of research. However, other voices query the depth and extent of community-based research if there are no real strategies developed to transform people’s livelihoods. To address this lacuna, proposals for active partnerships between Universities and other stakeholders, both public and private, are being mooted. At the heart of such proposal is that knowledge on development concerns should be shared and owned by all the stakeholders and that responsive and sustainable development should be research-informed. This raises pertinent questions that are in line with open science collaboration that this study seeks to answer, viz. In which ways and to what extent are beneficiaries involved in the design, implementation and evaluation of community-driven human development activities? How can the sharing of knowledge and collaboration with other stakeholders enhance effectiveness and efficiency of research in informing community-driven human development activities? What are the sustainability implications for community-driven human development activities? In answering these questions, the study will illustrate how the sharing of knowledge through open science can contribute to effective collaboration among the stakeholders and sustainable community livelihoods.', 'The general approach\nThe study will adopt a qualitative research design where descriptions and interpretations (rather than measurement and prediction) based on the stakeholders’ narratives are privileged in order to arrive at a rich understanding of their experiences and preferences with regard the community development interventions. The qualitative approach will be preferred since it reflects a vital humanistic element of respect to respondents by making their ideas, stated in their own terms, the important data source for the evaluation in a way that takes into account idiosyncrasies, uniqueness, and complex dynamics. \nThis approach will be useful in assessing the role of research in informing development initiatives, importance of knowledge sharing and collaboration among different stakeholders, factors that influence community participation in the development programs or activities; factors that influence performance in terms of what is working or not working (what would work and what would not work) well; the expected outcomes or achievements of open and collaborative development initiatives; the value attached to certain development projects; and how to promote sustainability of the development programs through participatory research process and collaboration. \nStudy population and sampling\nThe study will include respondents from the two partnering Universities: Uganda Martyrs University and the University of Notre Dame. Other stakeholders including government and civil society actors will also be included. The community, as recipients or beneficiaries of development initiatives will also be included. Being a qualitative study, the sample size will not be determined under considerations of numerical representativeness but rather on prospects for in-depth information. In this approach, “the range and completeness of experience studied is not as important as picking experiences that can be said to be insightful revelations, a good contribution to [rich] understanding” (Stake 2010, p.57).  \nData collection tools\nThe Key Informant Interview (KII) guide: This will be used to collect in-depth information about the expectations of the respondents with regard to development programs. KIIs will be conducted with the actors, including University representatives and program directors, central government officials who influence policy and local government-based community development workers, stakeholders from the various civil society activists within the community, community group leaders and household heads of direct program beneficiaries.  The information to be collected will range from the centrality of research in informing development initiatives, importance of knowledge sharing extent of community participation in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of community development initiatives; perceptions about performance against targets and factors that influence performance; challenges and opportunities for knowledge sharing and collaboration; elements of good practices and lessons learned; expected outcomes or results and sustainability of community development initiatives, among others.\nFocus group discussion (FGD) guide: This will be used to explore community perception of the community development program or activities, in terms of their level and extent of participation and assessment of program results. Information on issues like importance of involvement and knowledge sharing in the selection, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of development programs and activities; determination of community priorities and design of interventions; perceived benefits from existing and preferred development initiatives; the role of participation and knowledge sharing in influencing the relevancy or acceptance of interventions and effectiveness of implementation; the value attached to performance of/in community development initiatives and possible outcomes; male-female participation for gender purposes; sharing of benefits and sustainability of the activities will be collected. Participants in FGDs will be selected from households participating in the program activities. The exact number of households within the participating villages will be ascertained during pilot study. The participants will be mobilised by the participating members themselves. Use of secondary data will complement primary findings.', 'The study will progress in six phases. The first phase will include selection and orientation of the research team, review of existing community development programs, review of related documents, and the preliminary framing of the study, including updating the methodology and developing the data collection tools. The second phase will be pilot phase, and final refinement of methodology and data collection tools. The third phase will include actual data collection, transcribing, data analysis and drafting the report. The fourth phase will include dissemination of findings to the stakeholders and community members for validation. The fifth phase will include development of two training manuals: one for the training of researchers and the other for government, civil society and community leaders in open and collaborative research and development. The sixth and final phase will be the publication of the report. \nTraining for both categories will be mindful of the key themes of the study and emerging information on the ways and to what extent are beneficiaries involved in the design, implementation and evaluation of community-driven human development activities; sharing of knowledge and collaboration with other stakeholders enhance effectiveness and efficiency of research in informing community-driven human development activities; and sustainability implications for community-driven human development activities. This will help to benchmark the introduction and strengthening of open and collaborative science and illustrate in practical sense how the sharing of knowledge through open science can contribute to effective collaboration among the stakeholders and sustainable community livelihoods. \nActive and direct involvement of government, civil society activists and community leaders is expected to yield overarching effects in actual influence of policy.', 'Clear project outcomes will be determined and performance indicators developed for achieving these outcomes. Timeframes will be considered for each result area and strictly followed.

In the last 13 years, with the development of the speciesLink network and the last 6 years with the development of Brazil&rsquo;s Virtual Herbarium, focus has been given in convincing data providers on the benefit of sharing data and thus increasing their visibility and importance.

Support is available for short term project based activities leading to e-infrastructures&rsquo; development. Users expect free (including no cost) and open access to data and tools (as in using Google). Is this affirmation true? What is the sustainability model for infrastructures that are long-term initiatives, heavy on maintenance, need to do &ldquo;more of the same&rdquo; over time, and that, in the case of biological collections, receive data at no cost, and have users that culturally are not prepared to pay for data services?

(79, 'Amel Fahmy is a long experienced researcher, she had managed and supervised several research projects in the area of gender and violence against women. She is an anthropologist by training and is well trained in both qualitative and quantitative method. She has just finalized an IDRC funded study on assessing crowdsourcing methods, were she utilized a multiple research methods. Copy of the study can be found in the below link:\nhttp://harassmap.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Towards-A-Safer-City_full-report.pdf', 'Assessing Women access to ICTs in Egypt', 'Egypt', 'Sexual harassment in public spaces remains a growing problem in the Egyptian society, with more than 95% of women participated in  different studies reported being frequently subjected to different forms of sexual harassment (HarassMap 2014, UN Women 2013). Gender inequality and spread patriarchal values and practices in Egypt is the underpinning factor for the continuation of sexual harassment on daily basis in public space. Women are not welcomed in public spaces and accessing these spaces are widely seen as means to undertake tasks/ errands related to their  domestic duties. In the occasions where women attempt to access public space for political participation or for leisure and celebration  women have been sexually attacked\n\nThere is little doubt that the use of various information and communication technologies (ICTS) have played a significant role to bring the issue of sexual harassment in the public space and to an extend issues of violence against women to global attention and has ignited new youth activism to combat what has been seen as a growing problem. (Aouragh & Alexander 2011; Castells 2012; Khamis and Vaughn 2013).  Furthermore, ICTS provide for the possibility of creating or enhancing services by state organizations as well as NGOs or independent initiatives to address different issues related to gender based violence. (GBV) For example, disseminating information regarding women’s sexual rights, sexual health and safety, access to services for victims of violence and many others. These services have the potential to contribute to advancing women’s accessing and  participating in public spaces\n\nNew forms of activism in Egypt involving ICT use has been made possible by the growth and ease in the availability of varying technologies, primarily Internet-access but also mobile phones. In 2014, the World Economic Forum placed Egypt at a dismal 91st place out of 144 countries in terms of ICT infrastructure development, which is an 11-point decline from 2013 (Daily News 2014; WEF Report 2014). However, as of December 2013, the rate of Internet penetration has reached almost half the country at 45% (MCIT 2014). Similarly, mobile phone penetration rates increased to a current 118%, indicating that while almost half of Egyptians had access to the Internet, almost all Egyptians owned at least one mobile phone. Moreover, a healthy number of Egyptians access the Internet via their mobile phones, with mobile Internet use representing 37% of all Internet-use in Egypt.  \n\nThe growth of social media, however, has likely outpaced most other forms of Internet use and all of the new initiatives focused on sexual harassment that have sprung up since the revolution operate in Facebook and Twitter. Lim has argued that social media “are the media of urban youth” in Egypt, where household internet-penetration rates are disproportionately high in Cairo at 64% (2012: 235). \n\nThere is very little information/data on the ICT gender gap as well as how women are currently making use of these ICTS in-order to highlight the issue and other gender-based violences exercised despite growing global statistics of the use of ICT and mobile phones as shown above.  Further, Laila Abu Lughod has argued for the need to understand discourses of Muslim women’s rights through “not just the social circulation …or the social contexts of its reproduction, transplantation, or vernacularization, but its differential mediation through various social networks and technical instruments” (2010: 2-3). Also there is a need for critical analysis that examines the everyday negotiations of activists with the technologies they employ. \n\nThis proposal employs different research methods both qualitative and quantitative to answer the following questions:\n\nTo what extend  ICTs is being used by state and non-state organizations  to address issues related to gender-based violence?\nTo what extend women and girls used these available ICTs ?\nWhat are the challenges facing women and girls in using  available ICTS on relevant issues?\nIs there a strategy on GBV that include/recommend the use of ICT and to what extend it is implemented?\nTo what extent have ICTs made a noticeable impact on the ability of women and girls to participate in the public space?\nAre there laws and legislations to punish the use  of ICT tools in acts of gender based violence\nWhat are the challenges faced by the activists/initiatives employing ICT methods in Gender based violence related issues?\n how differing technologies help to make certain activities possible or facilitate the spread of certain messages (or not),', 'household Survey\n\nSurvey data will be conducted in four governorates in Egypt. Data collected will include indicators on use and access of ICTs tools in  relation to relevant issues. A pilot phase will be conducted to refine questionnaire questions. \n\nFocus group discussions (FGDs)\n\nA total of 36 FGDs will be conducted in selected Egyptian governorates. \n\nThe FGDs will be conducted among women between the age of  18-45 from the above mentioned governorates from different social, educational and martial backgrounds.\n\n In-depth interviews (IDIs)\n\n\nA total number of 30 IDIs will be conducted with co-founders and implementers of ICT initiatives in relevant fields, policy makers, law enforcement officers, GBV activists and government officials.   \n\nInterviews and focus groups will be taped and transcribed. The data will then be entered into a qualitative data program for further analysis.  We will utilize data coding systems to ensure confidentiality (encrypting and indexing devices). We will develop a system for regular handover of field notes and interviews to be entered into the analysis programme. The data will be then arranged in an orderly matter for final analysis. Data coming from the questionnaires will be coded and entered using SPSS\n\n\nProtection of subject’s privacy\nFor qualitative data collection, field notes and interview notes will be recorded then encrypted to protect the information concerning informant identity and location. \nWe intend to audio tape all focus groups, in-depth interviews unless expressed otherwise by the interviewees. The recorded tapes will be stored in a locked file cabinet until the transcription is competed and then will be erased. Only senior researchers will have access to the file cabinet.\n\nSteps to avoid coercion\nWe will clearly inform all participants about the names and affiliations of the research’s team, the objectives and expected outcomes of the study, issues to be discussed, how long it will take, potential risk as a result of participating, as well as their right to terminate their participation at any time. Potential subjects will be informed that their participation is strictly voluntary and that there are no negative consequences as a result of their refusal to participate.  There will be no payments or gifts for participation, thereby avoiding economic coercion.\n\nPotential risks\nThe main risk involved in this study is invasion of privacy and the possibility of experiencing psychological discomfort. Therefore notes will be encrypted so that the identity of the subject is protected, no information from any interviews will be revealed by the researchers during another interview. Also participants will be told that we cannot discuss responses from other subjects and that information discussed in the group will not be discussed outside of the research setting.\n\nData collectors and training\n\nData collectors will be experienced personnel who preferably have a socio-anthropological background. They will be provided with in-depth orientation and training on how to collect the quantitative and qualitative data for this research.

The scale of recent disasters highlights the need for a holistic approach to address and plan for them (Joshi et al., 2007), thus, the need for disaster recovery plans (DRPs). The aim of a DRP is to ensure that entities (e.g. organisations, countries) function effectively during and following a disaster (Bryson et al., 2002).</p><p>A well thought out DRP can play a major role in an organization&rsquo;s/country&rsquo;s survival/success (Fallara, 2003). Operationalizing a plan requires the communication and coordination of a number of authorities (e.g. public services, government agencies) and requires access to many sources of data. In many cases, the poor response to disasters has been blamed on the lack of communication and coordination among these relevant authorities and the lack of availability of critical information. If these authorities and the communication and coordination that needs to take place between them can be captured in a central and formal representation it will help improve the responsiveness to disasters as there will be a common point of reference, readily accessible to all, in a language understood by all. One such representation is an ontology which provides a formal description of a domain that can be shared among different applications and expressed in a language that can be used for reasoning (Noy, 2004).</p><p>The development of these DRPs require a great deal of resources, the coordination and collaboration of a number of stakeholders and the access to a number of disparate data sources so their development can be expensive which makes it infeasible for SIDS to undertake individually. At the same time many of these SIDS are susceptible to similar disasters and therefore rather than each state undertaking this very individually it would be more beneficial for them to collaborate for effective development of these plans. For example, many islands in the Caribbean are susceptible to hurricanes and the structures and techniques in place for managing these could be similar. Therefore, it would be beneficial for these countries to collaborate and share data to not only make the DRP more cost effective but also to improve their quality.</p><p>This sharing of data will require that these states come together and agree that they will make this data available to other partners. However, to facilitate this collaboration and the integration of these data stores there must be a common language that can be used to address the ambiguity, inconsistency and communication problems that may arise when loosely connected organizations are required to work together and when disparate data sources are to be integrated and shared. This research will use a design science approach to develop an ontology, as this common language for the development of disaster recovery plans, and will demonstrate how the ontology can be used by SIDS in the sharing of disaster recovery information. In summary, this research demonstrates the use of a DRP ontology to provide this common language and demonstrates how this ontology can be used to develop consistent disaster recovery plans that can be shared across countries.</p><p>The approach will be evaluated using a case study of Caribbean countries, a number of which are both in hurricane and earthquake zones. In terms of the Open and Collaborative Science (OCS) research focus this project will address both:</p><p>(T2): Infrastructures &amp; Technologies in that the DRP ontology will be developed in a collaborative way and can be shared across SIDS. The ontology can become an important component of a disaster recovery planning information system;</p><p>(T3): Communities of Practice in Open and Collaborative Science by exploring how an Open Science approach can seek to mobilize a community of practitioners and stakeholders around a common shared problem space, specifically the threat of natural disasters in the Caribbean; and</p><p>(T4): Potential Impacts of OCS as we evaluate whether the collaborative approach, enabled through the shared Ongtology, will lead to a better understanding, at the regional level of the issues and solution for effective disaster recovery planning.</p>', '<p>This research will use a design science approach to the establishment of an open methodology for disaster recovery planning and will demonstrate the importance of the DRP ontology for this (Hevner 2004). The methodology proposed will be evaluated using the observational method of a case study of the Caribbean region. All SIDS in the Caribbean would have access to this ontology and would be the reference point for all integration of the disparate data that can be agreed to be open and accessible by all partners on this project.</p><p>The DRP ontology will represent the target and solution resources. The target resources are those that need to be protected and must be addressed in the DRP while the solution resources are those that are used to carry out the tasks that must be performed as part of the DRP. It should be noted that it is possible for solution resources to require other solution resources (e.g. the deployment of an emergency vehicle requires the utilization of emergency crews) and this must be represented as it is important to know, at any time, how many of a given solution resource have been utilized and how many are available.</p><p>The DRP ontology will also represent the location of the resources which is essential if they are to be protected (in the case of target resources) and located (in the case of solution resources). Information about the location of the resources will also assist in determining where the solution resources need to be deployed. Various disasters are likely to affect different locations and capturing this information before the disaster occurs is essential as it helps to ensure that this is taken into account when generating the DRP. Thus the plan focuses on those areas that are likely to be most affected and helps to ensure that the limited resources are used most effectively. Knowing where the resources are located and which locations are affected by a particular type of disaster also helps to ensure that the solution resources are not stored in affected areas.</p><p>There have been cases where DRPs cannot be put into operation because the solution resources have become inaccessible when the disaster occurs. For example, in New Orleans there was a plan in place to evacuate persons using school buses in the event of a hurricane. However when Hurricane Katrina struck the location of the buses made them inaccessible because of the amount of flooding in the area. This example also demonstrates the need to ensure that it is well understand beforehand which disasters commonly co-occur as this can also reduce the impact of a disaster. In the case of New Orleans the disaster domain ontology could represent the fact that in the event of a hurricane it is possible that flooding may occur and if it is known where the hurricane is likely to hit, then it could be determined where the flooding is likely to occur.</p><p>The concepts covered in the disaster domain ontology are similar across countries, especially in cases where they are susceptible to similar disasters (e.g. countries of the Caribbean) and therefore this ontology is reusable. Once a country acquires the ontology, it will have to identify the instances of each of the concepts, that is, it will have to identify all of its solution and target resources, roles, actors, locations, etc. and include them in the ontology. This data is available in disparate sources and again the ontology is used to integrate these disparate sources and check their consistency to ensure that they can be shared effectively.</p>', '<p>This research will produce a number of deliverables as the project develops. Through the hosting of an initial workshop that will bring together various stakeholders from across the Caribbean region it will be a first step in developing awareness of both the importance of disaster recovery for the region and also the possibilities that are open to countries and entities within these countries if they are willing to collaborate and share information. This discussions will include the National Disaster organizations, of the various countries, that are responsible for disaster management (e.g. The Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Planning (ODPEM) in Jamaica).</p><p>The DRP ontology developed from this project can be used by SIDS across the world to assist in tackling the problems that are similar to the Caribbean region. This ontology can be a component of Knowledge Systems being developed for disaster recovery planning. While this research has a significant practical component it will also result in at least 2 scholarly articles which will be submitted to relevant journals. So the information can be disseminated to other researchers that can build on this contribution. Finally, the research should influence policy in the region both as it pertains to disaster recovery but also as it pertains to the importance of collaborative, open approaches to solving problems that are common throughout SIDS.</p>', '<p>Given the outcomes outlined above there are some clearly defined deliverable expected from this project and therefore the success and impact would be measured accordingly. For example, it was stated that for the research contribution there should be some output in scholarly articles so that the importance of this work for researchers is understood and could be extended further. T</p><p>he project budget has included some expertise to develop these plans so the knowledge and expertise within the region both in the area of open and collaborative science and disaster recovery planning will be increased. Additionally, given the stakeholders that would be included in the project it is likely that there will be some changes in the approaches to both disaster recovery planning and open source policies in the Caribbean region. A detailed project plan will be developed to ensure that the project targets are being monitored and that the project deadline stays on target.</p>', '$66,993.24', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/OCSD_Letter_of_Support.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSD_Budget1.xlsx', 43, 255, 'complete', 'yes', 1411251628, 'complete', 'An interesting research question with an interesting potential outcome.

Thus in addition to the core team, others members will be called in as need arises given their specialty. Currently the team is composed of three academic members of staff with the following competencies:\n1. Innocent Semali is an epidemiologist with interest in health system, household survey  infectious diseases and nutrition among others.   He has also an experience of working with district health teams  through the Tanzania Essential Health Intervention Project .\n2. Edwwin Neyela in an IT specialist with interest in networking, troubleshooting and configuration and maintenance of servers.\n3. Anna Kessy is a public health specialist with interest in nutrition, utilization of health services, community mobilization and household survey.', 'Enhancing participation and the effectiveness of District Planning in Tanzania: A case study using open collaborative sciences', 'Tanzania', 'Regional strategies in Africa towards realizing the MDGs included African government’s adoption and ratification of the Ouagadougou Declaration on primary health care in 2008. The declaration urges African countries to adopt and use Primary Health Care strategies which includes among others; multisectoral action, community participation and unconditional enjoyment of health as a human right by all. Whereas countries should adopt the declaration within their national contexts the focus should include; leadership and governance for health, 2) health services delivery, 3) human resources for health, 4) health financing, 5) health information systems, 6) health technologies, 7) community ownership and participation, 8) partnerships for health development, and 9) research for health. \n\nCommunity ownership and participation was envisaged as response to governance elements to enhance participation in planning, resource allocation, implementation monitoring and evaluation within decentralization by devolution to district as contexts. It has been enshrined in the governance policies of African countries including Tanzania for decades. Despite that there are no empirical data on the practice and contribution of community participation towards the achievement of health and development goals.  Community participation as designed in the current reforms includes representation of communities in health facility boards, development committees, hospital boards and council social services committees. The representatives from the communities are responsible for collecting community inputs and forwarding them to higher levels. Also, the representatives are responsible for top bottom linkage to the communities.  \n\nThe persistence to use community representation as a means of community participation in the current health reforms prompts the need to determine additional strategies that will enhance achieving the desired development goals. Such a strategy would include adaptation of Open and Collaborative Science designs such as crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing is defined as " the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and outsourcing it to an undefined (and generally large) network of people in the form of an open call. This can take the form of peer-production (when the job is performed collaboratively), but is also often undertaken by sole individuals. The crucial prerequisite is the use of the open call format and the large network of potential labourers."  \n\nConsequently it is anticipated that crowdsourcing will facilitate community empowerment and eventually broader community participation and other stakeholders in their own development. Goal of community empowerment is to enhance capacity of the community in analyzing their environment, prioritizes problems, take a lead in solving those problems ensuring access to all thus achieve better wellbeing and equity.\n\nThe study will be set to answer several questions in theme FOUR on Potential Impacts (Positive and Negative) of Open & Collaborative Science. The questions to be answered includes will the use of OCS lead to a redistribution of resources, labor, and policy focus? If so, what are the social, economic and political consequences of these changes?\n\nThe study will generate information the feasibility of OCS use in rural district planning and management for development in Tanzania. In addition it will provide capacity strengthening for community networking, participation and interaction with the district health system. It will enable putting together contributions from many stakeholders from the community of beneficiaries as well as those of secondary stakeholders. Consequently the results will be collective intelligence that is superior compared to a decision from one or even a small group. \n\nThe collective intelligence represents ideas and wishes from more members of the community. The design will ensure taking onboard vulnerable groups who will include women, girls, disabled, youths, poor and other marginalized groups in the community. In addition it will also include leaders, health providers, extensions officers and opinion leaders. With this wider inclusion it can be agreed that it far more wider and in-depth community participation compared to current practices. As a result there will be better understanding of the problems affecting the district, solutions, resource mobilization and objective resource allocation. On the other hand it will facilitate objective and rational monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of district plans and as a result improved sustainable development of the district. Therefore the aim of this study will be to enhance participation and effectiveness of district planning using open collaborative sciences as a case study in Tanzania.', 'Provision of Social and Health services are decentralized by devolution to districts in Tanzania. Ideally in such decentralization community ownership and participation is envisaged in planning, resource allocation, implementation monitoring and evaluation at district and lower levels of the devolution. Though Tanzania has been practicing decentralization to districts by devolution the benefits have been rather limited. \nIn addition there are no empirical data on the practice and contribution of community participation towards the achievement of health and development goals.  \nCommunity participation as designed in the current reforms includes representation of communities in health facility boards, development committees, hospital boards and council social services committees. The representatives from the communities are responsible for collecting community inputs and forwarding them to higher levels. Also, the representatives are responsible for top bottom linkage to the communities, despite that there has been only limited achievements in the social sectors including health. Thus calling for innovative methods that will lead o compressive \nThe aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of collecting information from various stakeholders (crowdsourcing) within the decentralization contexts and structures to plan and implement a district health plan. The intervention will include establishing a web-based platform that is accessible using hand phones. At the beginning stakeholders from all levels of decentralization including community members will be informed and trained on how to send information to the free-tall website. The web site will have the capacity to aggregate the responses in to common broader problems after which the broad problems will be posted to the stakeholders as messages asking for solutions of such problems within the contexts of their district including ways which resources can be mobilized. \nThe intended intervention will generally focus on the gaps identified in the baseline assessment in the study ward. The intervention will be implemented at different level as presented below;\nD. At the District level: Focus will be at training and working with district health managements teams, council, other stakeholders including district panning officer. \nE. At the ward level: Based on the gap identified from the baseline, ward authorities will be trained on empowerment and community participation skills. The training will also focus on planning as well as how to take on board community needs as identified in the process. \n\nF. Implementation of the interventions at community level shall involve at each level to empower community through use of OCS facility. The phones will use free toll facility (prepaid). The members from wards, villages and hamlets will be trained how to use the free toll to send and read messages regarding existing problems and solutions. This will facilitate the  following: \na. shall facilitate dialogue, \nb. Community engagement \nc. Collective actions in the community \nk. community support manifesting as favourable attitudes, and greater resource commitment\nl. Improved utilization of service as well as better health outcomes and consequently positive impacts on health of the communities.\n\nThe project will be implemented one remote district (Handeni) in three phases as follows:\nPhase one: This will involve assessment of the districts planning processes. This will include when it starts, who participate in the planning focusing on community involvement and which information is used as input in the planning process. At this phase there will also be a determining the perceptions of the communities, health workers and the district leaders on the use of web-based facility to identify both problems as well as the solutions. \n\nPhase two: creation of hand phone data bases that would be used to source health problems (system and community based). There will also be setting up of hand phone accessible web site with a software facility that will handle and process responses to questions and other information submitted to the website. This will be followed by monitoring and evaluation using relevant indicators and rollout to other districts before national level adoption', 'Tanzania is among the least developed countries and home to underperforming systems including the health system characterized by high level of poverty.

The academic trajectory  approximate him of themes as opens softwares and hardwares, guiding courses and workshops like: Initiation on Linux for kids, in association with ACEL institute in the PUPA project; workshops in open hardwares and softwares in SESC.\nIn 2012 started the doctorate in physic in the Institute Technological of Aeronautic (ITA), which was abandoned when the academic framework based on papers and abstract studies, inaccessible to the average public, could not please him anymore. This was a motivation in the search for research alternatives, what intensify his will for research, create and share.On this quest he got to know open prototyping platforms, like arduinos, and got deeper in theme, starting to create and research many projects, like : residential automation system, systems to measure the temperature of a compound, homemade microscopy and spectroscopy , hydrogen and ozone generators, automation of irrigation, Internet for rural areas, etc.\nMarcela Guerra is the collaborator researcher.

As an educator, worked with kids  on the conscious care of nature and the re-signification of the traditional cultures. At the present she research the means to share knowledge for freedom, in a manner that the technology can assist the citizen in respect to the individual and its culture.\n\nHiurê e Marcela , with their baby  Dorah Galáxia spend the last 6 months traveling, visiting friends with their hacker box, helping  in the problems solving. Now, the family is dedicated to the application of those practices in rural areas, where they also pretend to establish.They believe in a new education that dare the common use of technology, where the knowledge is a right and sharing it a duty , overtaking the instituted spaces, been built on the practice through the local needs.', 'Mobile Hacker: The study of scientific and technological apropriation of rural communities through open and collaborative science.', 'Brazil', 'This project aims to improve appropriation on science and technology by rural communities and their inclusion in open and collaborative science. In order to achieve this, a mobile laboratory will be implemented, to bring access to information and basic resources for research studies in rural areas. It is our hope to detect the infrastructure needs for open and collaborative science to take place in areas in need of development.\n Despite the developing potential of technology, we can notice that the technology that slowly reach the rural areas does not perform as it should, keeping it in the most superficial and commercial form, concluding that the infrastructure needed to practice open and collaborative science is much more than internet and mobile phone access (there are necessary tough) . On that way, how can we assist the needy communities to deal with the new technology in a appropriative way, making it a tool to improve their life?\n"Serra da Mantiqueira" is the location chosen for this project, covering three states in the Brazilian Southeast, it is an important source of water food and natural resources for the main capitals in this region. The location is marked by different levels of development throughout its area. Despite its importance, many locations in this region are in need of technology and infrastructure. Many rural workers suffer from problems such as quality and hygiene for their products, climate changes, invasions of fungi and bacteria, in addition to contaminated water.  Because "Serra da Mantiqueira" comprehend many nuances through its territory,  a particular area is going to be used for the study, the neighbor cities of São Thomé das Letras, Carrancas, Cruzília and Luminárias, in the south of Minas Gerais. In those areas besides the problems above outline there are some other issues, there are native people leaving the rural area, allowing a scarcity of work-force. One of the reasons for that to happen is the difficulties of countryside living, like the hard work for a unsatisfactory financial return. Another common problem is the significantly increase of cattle areas, that people rent to raise the family income, leading to an increasing deforestation and headwater destruction. These problems can all be addressed by studies carried out by means of open and collaborative science.\nDue to the fact that access to technology in this region is recent, the function of these media is not yet consolidated, making it possible to introduce them in a more open manner. In order to do this, our goal is to bring a mobile laboratory, nicknamed "hacker móvel" with Internet access and computers to these people, with guidance for problems detected along the way. Such problems can be addressed with basic devices, such as Arduino boards and other low-cost scientific equipment, depending on the specific problem at hand. During this process people will learn how to to use platforms for information sharing,  basic research tools and how to share open data through open science network, participating in the knowledge production process, driven by issues that are of local relevance. This knowledge will be made available in a local Internet network , and later disseminated in other open and collaborative studies media, such as hackerspaces throughout the country.\n     Some limitations can be detected for introduction of these communities in the open science network. It is common for people over the age of 50 to be illiterate, making use of available open information limited. Younger people with access to basic education commonly attended public schools in the precarious Brazilian system, with no encouragement for autonomy or respect for the particular nature of local realities.\nIn order to deal with the language and cultural limitation a local network will be developed, both at the virtual and physical levels, from inside to the outside, so the science can be born in the rural areas, been made by the rural citizen, on that way they can overcome the tools there are need for them to become scientists of their own reality. This network will have as a basic premise respect for the timing and culture of these rural spaces, taking in to account matters of relevance for their development and autonomy.\nBy means of difficulties faced in introduction of this information exchange system we will address structural and cultural issues preventing the use of technology and science as a tool for emancipation of rural communities, and how it transform their life, deepening our understand of the positive and negative impacts of OCS.', 'In the rural area studied there are some tradition that are: the “ ajuntório” ( getting people together to build someone houses), the weekend visits ( people use the weekend to go to the neighbors house) and the exchange system &#40; that people give to the others some of their food production&#41;. Such cultural traits will be used during incorporation of the idea of open and collaborative science.\nA trailer, nicknamed “hacker móvel” , will be equipped with unidirectional antennas, routers, wifi and computers for internet acess; webcams for construction of  microscopes and spectrometers for analysis; electronic devices and sensors followed by electronic prototypes platform to measure temperature, luminosity, humidity, pressure, movement and others; a set of solar panels, mini wind turbines, charge controllers and batteries to provide electric power when necessary, will visit the families.The hacker móvel  will be parked inside peoples properties, been part of their day by day life, as a common good, on that way dissolving the existing barriers to new approaches.\n    In the first meetings, an assessment will take place and interested families will be listed.  With these data, tools available in the hacker móvel unit can be presented to these people.\nAt a later time the hacker móvel will change its parking area between the interested families periodically,at which time guidance will be provided about basic use of computers, research means in the open and collaborative science community, as well as how they can assist in use of these tools. Difficulties will be recorded and the entire experience will be shared via wikis and the entire network of partner hackerspaces so it can help on other development initiatives.\nDuring this process, the local network should already be in use for sharing of products and exchanges, according to specific needs, rescuing the rural custom of sharing production.\nOnce these people have acquired basic knowledge of research means and computer mechanisms, collective research will start. Collective research has the goal of assessing and sharing topics with the network, both at the local and external levels. From this moment on, in addition to periodic meetings at the households, hackathons will be organized for rural populations and representatives of hackerspaces in Brazil and abroad as a extension of the “ajuntório” practice, where people work collectively and voluntary to solve problems. With each hackathon a new hackerspace will be added to the network.\nEverything will be published on the network, and it is based on both, positive and negative lessons learned during implementation of this project, that difficulties on technological empowerment in rural areas will be mapped.', 'The “hacker móvel” project has as its long term objective bringing scientific and technological emancipation to inhabitants of rural areas, in addition to fostering unicity by means of these practices, constituting political thinking to claim and rethink postures with government agencies and their own communities, always with open and free information.\nWe are aware that in order to reach these objectives, initial steps must be taken.The first results we hope to achieve are: that people from rural areas get familiarized with the OCS making it an alternative for education and access to information that does not always reach the countryside; development of applied science to facilitate daily practices and make possible, in small steps, scientific empowerment; development of appropriate instruments to assist in food security, water treatment, animal breeding and family farming, optimizing techniques used in the field; increasing family income and knowledge produced in the field; put researchers from hackerspaces in touch with rural families, creating legitimate scientific study spaces to support surrounding communities, multiplying the idea of collaborative science; combine digital and traditional knowledge to not only strengthen existing networks, but also to create new ones.\nThis study aims at bridging the gap between practice and studies, making them complementary. In practical terms, information will be gathered about cultural and social aspects that make it difficult to insert people from rural areas in OCS, and the same information can be used for implementation of the project.', 'All the steps on the project will be documented and available on the open platforms. Prototypes and results of the study will be documented by the people taking part in the project, constituting participatory analysis material. Thus, progress during the project can be easily observed.\nAt the end of each period a hackathon will be organized, and this will have an important role in evaluation of the plan. During the hackathons videos and interviews will be produced, including basic questions to be asked of project participants, who will be invited to evaluate the development of the project and the needs for adjustments.\nVisits to family households will also be used to measure both the negative and positive impact of the project. During each visit, a proposal will be made for a new activity, always with the objective of improving appropriation of the tools used in the solutions offered to the family. By assessing whether the specific problem was solved or lessened by the solution offered.\nIn our experience, establishment of a Steering Committee for the project can be a very effective manner of establishing a proper M&E mechanism. With representatives of all parties involved (supporting partner, implementing partner and beneficiary), due transparency can be given to all actions, adjustments to planned activities can be made rapidly and efficiently, with participation of all interested parties. Meetings can be held via conference call, and the periodicity can be established in agreement held with the parties involved. Technical experts involved in project implementation provide the necessary inputs for decision-making and carry out the decisions reached during meetings. If necessary, experts in specific areas can be invited to issue opinions about any matters that require more in-depth discussions.\nTherefore, all monitoring and evaluation will be carried out by means of different strategies.', '69,380.62', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/Letter_of_endorsement_IDRC.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/Budget1.pdf', 67, NULL, 'complete', 'yes', 1410212967, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, 'yes');

The country’s fertility rate of seven children per woman, alongside child and maternal mortality rates at 130 per 1,000 live births and 420 per 100,000 women, respectively, are among the highest in the world. Many of these deaths can be prevented by improving health promotion and fostering behavioural change in mothers’ health practices.\nRCRA proposes to partner with OCSDNet to address the high maternal mortality rates that exist in rural greater Toro region by 2019.  If this geographic disparity is not addressed, Uganda is at risk of failing to meet the MDG of reducing maternal mortality by 75% by 2015 onwards.\nConverging available, affordable ICT tools, enabling access to high quality latest health information for preventable and curable diseases to reduce maternal mortality ratio.\n\nThe social context of maternal and neonatal health\nHigh levels of maternal, neonatal and prenatal mortality and morbidity are attributed to high fertility rates, lack of appropriate prenatal care, lack of skilled birth attendance, low levels of female literacy, gender issues, malnutrition among women of reproductive ages, and lack of access to emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC). Situation regarding some of these factors is presented below:\n• Literacy rates among women are very low, almost half of those among men; secondary school enrolment rate among girls is also half of that among boys. These gaps are much wider in rural areas.\n• Compared to men, women get food that is less in quantity and poorer in quality. National Nutritional Survey (2011-2012) showed that 16% lactating mothers were malnourished, iron deficiency was present in 45% mothers, while clinical anemia was reported in 29% of all mothers. In addition, daily calorie intake among pregnant and lactating women was 87% and 74% of the recommended calories, respectively.\n• About one fourth of women give birth at less than 18 years or over 35 years of age, and about 20% have four or more previous births – which greatly increases their risk of complications. It is also estimated that one out of every three births occurs within two years of a previous birth, increasing their risk of acquiring anemia and infections during pregnancy and delivery.\n• Rural women have limited access to healthcare and family planning. Nationwide, just about 24% deliveries are conducted by skilled birth attendants, only 27% women receive adequate prenatal care, and only 50% are immunized against tetanus. Contraceptive prevalence rate is about 34%, and unmet need of family planning is estimated at a high 33%.\n• Poverty is the root cause of most factors listed above. Poor families have no resources to call skilled health personnel or hire a transport in case of an emergency. They cannot afford private care, and often get the poorest quality of care in public health facilities. Maternal mortality is, therefore, significantly higher in rural areas,The SMS campaigns, supported by Text to Change, target both mothers and fathers with text messages about prenatal and postpartum care and HIV/AIDS, telling women how they can protect themselves and their unborn children against diseases and reminding families of the importance of going to health clinics for check-ups during pregnancy\nApplication of ICT for healthcare delivery and personal health management. The provision of useful, user-friendly and secure electronic services for citizens is predicated on the interoperability of different systems. RCRA will pursue an interoperability mandate by leveraging international standards and best practices for innovative service prototypes. \n\nMobile phones provide a promising platform for personalized health and well-being management services. Using these generic devices as a platform would allow the integration of behaviour change support into everyday situations. Mobile devices can also unobtrusively monitor users’ actions, and the resulting information can be used to facilitate behaviour self-monitoring, and to provide timely guidance and intervention. \n\nRCRA has a strategy to join forces with health service providers to apply science and technology to real life processes. \n in urban squatter settlements and in low-income population groups.\nRCRA’s mobile health platform will be used to generate cost-efficient mobile health implementations tailored to specific health consumer needs. It can monitor nutrition, new born care, care and follow up on discharged patients, healthcare information mental wellbeing, weight management and social activity. It also contains algorithms that combine information in order to provide feedback and guidance on general health and wellbeing.', 'RCRA will in partnership with international companies, establish a self-care model built on a mobile self-care management system.  The system will allow expectant mothers/clients to access remote diagnosis and receive clinical advice from home, send service requests and get supportive feedback. The project seeks to develop an easy-to-use mobile application with decision support capability, as well as leading the clinical trial for evaluating the new self-care model. The system will record the clients’ last safe menstruation period, algorithm in the system will estimate the expected delivery day in a week which will be taken as the latest week of delivery, the clients will be informed periodically as shown above in the RCRA design model  \nThe programmed application will empower/update clients on when to go for Antenatal care to the 4th visit, however the system will inform the clients in the last trimester to start preparing for safe delivery, be attended by a trained midwife, deliver from the hospital/health centre and in case of any emergency, the client will call in the system eg dial 14251 talk to a clinician, 5 clinicians will be saved in the system to respond to emergencies, the clinicians will receive phone with long lasting batteries chargeable once in a  month, the clinicians will be empowered and trained, will have all contacts of DHOs and drivers of available Ambulances in government hospitals, so once an emergency has emerged the clinician will contact  a DHO in the area of the patient to send an ambulance  to collect the client to the nearest health centre III/IV. The project will facilitate drivers for saving life day and late night.\nThe procedure is that like any customer call helpline, the client will call in the system which has programed options, so the client/patient will select an option corresponding to her/his need, the system will forward a call to the 1st clinician if found busy the system will forward to the 2nd clinician and so on until the 5th respondent RCRA takes this as a paradigm that not all the 5 clinicians can be busy at the same time all day long.\n \nRCRA’s mobile health platform will be used to generate cost-efficient mobile health implementations tailored to specific health consumer needs. . It also contains algorithms that combine information in order to provide feedback and guidance on general health and wellbeing.\nThrough research the project will strengthen the Community capacity   to demand and utilize maternal health services as a health rights. The evidence gathered through research will help in women groups in sensitive health planning and advocacy process. \n\nThis will further enhance the right based approach to better maternal health service delivery. \n\nThe project will use modern technologies to address issues of access and utilization of antenatal health service delivery   for the marginalized persons/ communities in the Toro region creating a platform for policy engagement with the   duty bearers for service delivery accountability.\nBehavioural change resulting from increasing demand for health services at health centres will be achieved in the short run.\nAs a matter of knowledge building and information sharing the project will   empower communities and facilitate access to health information.\n\nuse of ICT tools will bolster timely efficient communication tool in access. \nThe project is based on media and innovative ICT mobile applications\nproject will facilitate development of mobile based applications, project modalities and prototypes.\nThe project is pathway to the creation of strong collaboration with thus leading to improved communication and collaboration between project partners on ICT4health.\n\nProject results will be collected, analyzed, aggregated and disseminated and shared with the stakeholders for the attainment of MDG 3,4 and 5  in Uganda.\n\n\nProviding online health information and interactive advisory support for different groups of patients, organizing doctor-patient remote sessions or on-site remote training in the case of emergency, or  drug management systems that keep track of stock and availability of drugs  are all examples where ICT has a crucial role. \n\nThe search and exchange of knowledge in the area of health care is yet another facet of e-health. ICT enables remote doctor-doctor consultation as well as real time instructions and treatment via telemedicine. In addition, it enables electronic publishing of research findings, access to catalogues of drugs and vaccines, access to information in medical databases, and development of expert systems that can help with diagnosis and treatment, as well as increased and free access to health and medical information for patients.', '8.

Germano has completed most of the work on the recently released open-source hardware Furnarius Rufus PCB Milling Machine.\n\n\nOur team have developed an open-source printed circuit board milling machine. The Furnarius Rufus PCB Milling Machine - Fresadora PCB João-de-Barro - consists of a low cost PCB manufacturing machine released in September 2014 under the CERN Open Hardware License v.1.2. This project was initiated by Centro de Tecnologia Acadêmica (CTA), IF/UFRGS in Porto Alegre, Brazil. This project aims at reducing the costs of PCB prototyping for scientific and educational applications by providing an open design that is easy to manufacture. This project is named after Furnarius Rufus, an oven bird that builds its nest with mud much alike an 3D printer as a tribute to those who make their own stuff.\n\n\nVideo 1 – Furnarius Rufus PCB Milling Machine in action: https://pt.wikiversity.org/wiki/Ficheiro:Fresadora_PCI_João-de-Barro.ogv.ogg\n\n\nFigure 2 - One Furnarius Rufus in his nest: https://pt.wikiversity.org/wiki/Ficheiro:Flickr_-_Dario_Sanches_-_JOÃO-DE-BARRO_(Furnarius_rufus)_(19).jpg\n\nOur design had the following targets\nLow cost (< US$ 1000 - parts only); \nHigh precision: capable of providing through-hole and SMD PCB layouts; \nEase to assemble: most parts can be assembled with bench drills, cutting and bending metal sheets. \nProject Documentation In order to build a community of users and developers this project is being documented in detail.

The repository also contain a description on how each part of the design was built. The project documentation can be found in a git repository hosted at the Centro de Tecnologia Acadêmica website. As of early September 2014 the first prototype is being assembled and the repository is being populated with detailed schematics for each mechanical part of the machine. With the public release of this project, we aim at encouraging groups to replicate and improve on the initial design.', 'Development of open workbench', 'Brasil; worldwide via web', 'The objective of this project[1] is to contribute to the development of shared infrastructure for design, construction, and use of open scientific and educational instrumentation. It will reach its objectives by i) joining efforts for developing and disseminating a common set of tools for building scientific apparatus using low cost digital fabrication technology, ii) researching and promoting best practices for sharing hardware designs, and iii) engage in the formation of a citizen science network for weather and environmental monitoring build upon this infrastructure.\nIn analogy to open source software, that required a set of basic tools in order to flourish, namely a text editor and a code compiler, open source hardware is in need of a basic set of tools that will facilitate the design, sharing, and manufacture of open scientific and educational technology. We consider these tools the basic infrastructure needed for collaboration on open scientific and educational instrumentation. We believe that the lack of a common digital infrastructure for building scientific apparatus is the current bottleneck for the effective sharing of practical knowledge that is usually encoded within its inner workings. The availability of such an infrastructure will increase the value and impact of repositories that host ready-to-build scientific and educational apparatus using digital fabrication technologies.\nThis project embraces on the development of an open source workbench: a set of low cost digital fabrication tools for prototyping and small scale manufacturing of scientific and educational instruments such as free software CAD tools and open source 3D printers. We refer to these set of tools the Open Workbench, integrating i) software for studying and designing scientific and educational apparatus and ii) digital fabrication tools for building such apparatus.\n\nOn the software aspects of the Open Workbench, this project has two areas of action:\n\n1. Study the state of current development of free software tools of Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools for Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC). This study will result in a report that will serve as guidelines for a more ambitious project for development of advanced free/libre AEC CAD tool. \n2. Join international efforts[2] for the development and integration of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools in order to integrate the design of electronic circuits to the fabrication of printed circuit boards and improve on the simulation capabilities of these tools. \n\nConcerning the hardware aspects this project will build upon the current popularity of open source 3D printers and improve the current state of the Open Workbench by\n1. Disseminating the recent released open hardware milling machine for the prototyping of printed circuit boards (PCB) for electronic circuits. \n2. Researching and developing digital fabrication tools that complements the 3D printer and the PCB milling machine. Further research is needed to define the properties of additional digital fabrication equipment, in particular, define desirable equipment able to shape metal pieces, or even pursue further development of the PCB Milling machine, including the fusion of 3D printer and PCB milling in the same equipment. \n\nIn addition to research and development on the software and hardware elements of the Open Workbench, this project aims at studying, improving, and applying best practices for collaborative open hardware development, aiming at defining structure, licensing, and best practices for building and encouraging collaboration in open repositories of open instrumentation and its applications. This project will also embrace on the application of the Open Workbench for citizen science; in particular to engage citizens in the assembly, repairs and applications of open hardware for data collection related to weather and environmental monitoring.\n\nNotes:\n0.

It has been shown to reduce 8-fold the cost of scientific instrumentation [3], thus increasing the accessibility to scientific instrumentation. However, given the current limitations of open source tools for hardware design and manufacturing, one can say that low cost personal fabrication and its applications for open science and education is still in its infancy. In particular, one lacks prototyping machines for electronic circuits (printed circuit boards) and digital fabricated parts able to work on wider temperature ranges and improved precision and strength than those provided by low cost 3D printers, which are usually made of polymeric plastics.\nOur vision for a complete Open Workbench for open instrumentation consists of several hardware and software tools that overcomes current material limitations and work-flows bottlenecks for the collaborative design, sharing and manufacturing of open scientific and educational instruments. Some of the desired hardware tools for the Open Workbench are already established as open technology, such as 3D printers. In our approach, the possibilities of 3D printing must be supplemented by complementary equipment to facilitate the prototypation of electronic circuits and also controlled shaping of metal parts. This project will research possible development routes, evaluating different CNC metal machining possibilities considering cost of equipment design, construction, safety of operation, maintenance, usability.\nAs important as low cost digital fabrication equipment, one can mention the free software tools used for design, visualization, and simulation of electronic, mechanical and geometrical designs to be build by these appliances. As pointed out by the yellow and red portions of Figure 1, these tools are in development, in need of integration, difficult to use, or non-existent under open licenses.\nWe consider that i) free software CAD tools and ii) digital fabrication tools for metal parts deserves special attention\n \nhttps://pt.wikiversity.org/wiki/Ficheiro:Open_source_workbench_Map_Sept_2014.svg\nFigure 1 - Open Source Workbench map as of Sept. 2014. Green: established as open technology; Yellow: work in progress; red: no development as open source tool or needs integration into existing work-flows.\n\nThe world needs free/libre CAD programs for sharing and editing 3D parts and projects with rich features and that is easy to learn and use. Open Educational and scientific endeavors will operate at higher levels with the advent of such tools. Researchers at CERN also realized this and are contributing to the development of KiCAD, for electronic designs [4]. CAD software of interest for open scientific instrumentation falls within several categories, namely:\n- Electronic Design Automation (EDA) \n- Computed Aided Design (CAD) for Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) \n- Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) \n\nOne Important missing feature of free and open-source EDA tools regards the simulation of analog and digital circuits integrated within the user interface.\n\n*Computer Aided Design*\nUnfortunately, as a consequence of the development gap between free-software and proprietary CAD, it is a common practice to use proprietary tools for the design of scientific instruments, thus seriously hindering open collaboration and sharing of scientific designs. The cost of proprietary CAD tools easily reaches tens of thousands of dollar per license.\n\nFreeCAD is a promising CAD tool for Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC). It is being developed by an international team of developers, see FreeCAD Developer hub. FreeCAD lacks advanced features.\n\n*Digital Fabrication*\nDigital fabrication is based on the application of Computer Numeric Control (CNC) to control the addition or subtraction of material in order to obtain an object with desired characteristics.\n  - Additive fabrication (3D printing) \n - Machining Centers: CNC Lathe or Turning Centers, Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM), Laser Cutters \n\nAlthough we have listed the desired features Open Workbench, there is still uncertainty regarding the possibility of low cost CNC tools for metal machining. \n\n*Open and Citizen Science*\nDuring the last years we have observed an increased citizen participation in the development of scientific projects. This is referred to as citizen science. The involvement of citizen range from minimal as in the donation of computer resources in projects such as SETI@Home and LHC@Home that uses the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC), to direct involvement such as The Galaxy Zoo where the cognitive habitabilities of citizen are involved.\nIn our approach for citizen science, citizens are engaged in building, installing, and using the scientific apparatus for weather and environmental monitoring. We have developed an pedagogical approach where introductory courses on Arduino engage the participants in the assembly, debug, and data acquisition of an weather station [6].\n\nNotes:\n3.

As researcher for the Kumusha Takes Wiki Project of the Africa Centre Moses März has contributed his empirical and theoretical insights to the Open initiative to foster alternative approaches to knowledge production in non-traditional spaces.\n\nOrganisation and Project detail\nWikiAfrica (www.wikiafrica.net) is an international collaboration working to support the ideals of the Open Movement in Africa. WikiAfrica leverages partnerships, support, technology and other tools to aggregate significant quality African content onto Wikipedia – fostering a pan-African culture of online contribution and advancing innovative methods to promote digital learning. The project is currently working on several initiatives including, Wiki Loves Africa (www.wikilovesafrica.org), Kumusha Takes Wiki in Uganda and Côte d''Ivoire, Wiki Entrepreneur in Malawi and Ethiopia and the OpenAfrica Toolkits project (www.wikiafrica.net/toolkits)\n\nThe Africa Centre (www.africacentre.net) is a not-for-profit social innovator that is based in Cape Town and works throughout Africa. The organisation was developed as a platform for exploring contemporary pan-African cultural practice and intellectual expression as catalysts for social change. Founded in 2005, the Africa Centre offers a space dedicated to the celebration, creation and performance of contemporary artistic expression and intellectual development in Africa. The organisation currently drives six innovative projects across a range of fields, one of which is the WikiAfrica project.', 'Mapping Wikipedia and Aligned Open Initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa – Analysing the usage and development potentials of Wikipedia and the aligned Open Movement across the African continent', 'All countries across sub-Saharan Africa', 'In line with the approach of Open and Collaborative Science (OCS), Wikipedia is the most ambitious attempt of knowledge production in the 21st century. Since its launch in 2001, Wikipedia has become an influential reference in African academic and non-academic circles. Its declared aim is to be “the sum of all human knowledge”. However, a common critique levelled at Wikipedia is that its overall coverage of Africa-related topics is lacking both the quantitative and qualitative content to adequately represent the empirical facts, as well as the multiplicity of languages and alternative epistemologies that shape African realities. \n\nThis acknowledged systemic bias currently prevents Wikipedia from offering meaningful and useful local knowledge to the majority of its current and potential users on the African continent. (See C.5. for details) This condition is endemic across the major language versions of Wikipedia, and is even more prevalent in the local language versions. \n\nThe consequent gaps in knowledge on platforms such as Wikipedia that are freely available to the citizens on the African continent limits the full development potentials that are offered by the general Wikipedia framework. The most immediate development potentials in this context are increased access to knowledge that is of immediate local relevance, empowerment of the populace through this knowledge, as well as a reconfiguration of the ‘geography of knowledge’ and the power relations that continue to shape it. \n\nFurther, online knowledge consumption, although rising with the advent of the mobile phone, is not at the same levels in Africa as it is in other regions. And, despite the release of Wikipedia Zero onto mobile phones as a zero-rated service by mobile operators in 12 African countries, there is a relatively low usage of this platform. Related to this lack of consumption, and impacting significantly on the inability of Wikipedia to combat systemic bias, is the low number of active editors of Wikipedia (known as Wikipedians) across the continent. It is assumed that the low level of consumption and contribution by editors is due to poor awareness of Wikipedia and a lack of understanding of the benefits of accessing (and contributing to) this knowledge. It could also be indicative of deeper, more complex issues; one being that people do not habitually use Wikipedia as they do not see themselves or their reality reflected in the platform. \n\nThis Open research project presents an in-depth case study of Wikipedia’s current and potential status in Africa. It creates a comprehensive map of how Wikipedia and related OCS online resources currently represent African topics, with a specific focus on the coverage of subjects that relate to the UN Millennium Goals and development issues more broadly. The goal of this study is to identify crucial aspects that could be improved in order to increase the reach, the quantity, the quality and the relevance of this content to African academic and non-academic audiences.\n\nThe goal of the critical research is to make a theoretical and empirical contribution to the following set of questions:\n1. What are the conceptions of knowledge and development that are endorsed by Wikipedia and aligned Open initiatives, and how do they relate to specific contexts in which development issues emerge in Africa?\n2. How is the African continent and country-specific information relevant to the UN Development Goals currently presented on Wikipedia and related OCS initiatives? What are the content gaps relating to Africa and the UN Millennium Development Goals and how does this lack of information affect the usage and relevance of Wikipedia across the continent?\n3. What factors (access, technical, conceptual) limit the habitual use of Wikipedia by the general populous?\n4. Which aspects could be improved by Africa-based or related OCS initiatives using the Wikipedia framework to make contents more relevant and accessible for African readers? And how can greater meaningfulness be translated into greater usefulness for specific development issues?\n\nThe concerns driving this study relate directly to Theme 4 of the OCSDNet Call for Papers, “Potential Impacts (Positive and Negative) of Open & Collaborative Science”. Through an engagement with cutting-edge theoretical debates in the Global South on the concepts of ‘knowledge’, ‘development’ and ‘openness’ this research project will create a conceptual framework and utilise existing research methodologies to evaluate the relevance for OCS approaches particularly in African contexts, as well as in the Global South. The empirical results from the case study of Wikipedia and related OCS initiatives in Africa will be analysed within this theoretical framework against the background of specific African contexts in which issues around the knowledge/development-nexus emerge.', 'This research project on the status of Africa as reflected in Wikipedia and related OCS initiatives is divided into four phases:\n\nPhase 1: Create a comprehensive theoretical and conceptual understanding and framework against which OCS approaches to knowledge production and development issues in Africa can be analysed.\nPhase 2: Map content and content gaps on Wikipedia relating to Africa, and provide critical research into how the available information (quantity, quality, format) affects current usage of Wikipedia across the continent.\nPhase 3: Investigate the knowledge consumption behaviours of consumers in diverse spaces across Africa, and identify barriers to consumption \nPhase 4: Map and create case studies and analysis of OCS interventions related to Wikipedia across Africa.\n \nPhase 1:\nThis phase will concentrate on a comprehensive study of the theoretical approaches that are emerging from the Global South, specifically relating to how ‘knowledge’ and ‘development’ are being conceptualised. The objective of Phase 1 is to create a conceptual framework by gaining a comprehensive understanding of a variety of dominant and alternative paradigms to knowledge production and its relation to development against which OCS approaches to knowledge productions can be analysed. Relevant research traditions addressing the issues of knowledge and development from the perspective of the Global South include: subaltern studies, cultural studies, postcolonial theory, decolonial theory.\n \nPhase 2:\nWorking with volunteers from within the Wikipedia movement, aligned open initiatives and regional Open consultants, the project will analyse existing content and identify content gaps on Wikipedia relating to Africa. This will be achieved through both quantitative analysis of content on African countries, and qualitative analysis of content on six specific countries in which usage have contrary patterns. Against the background of the theoretical framework created in Phase 1 we will assess the current quality of the present Wikipedia-content on Africa in the following manner: \n1. We will draw up a metric of content that ''should’ be included on Wikipedia about each country, as well as what development content that should be there; \n2. We will then assess the articles on 3 language Wikipedias relating to 6 diverse countries against the rubric. \n3. We will assess the quality of these articles against the theoretical framework that we have developed and the current Wikipedia quality rating system.\n \nPhase 3: \nWork with volunteers, Wikimedia groups and, aligned open initiatives and the regional Open consultants, to conduct critical research into 6 countries to analyse the online and mobile knowledge behaviours and habits of users (current and potential), and assesses the barriers to consumption and engagement. The research will establish the need, demand, use and ability to access Wikipedia and other OCS initiatives in targeted but representative population groups across the continent.\n\nPhase 4:\nAnalysis of OCS interventions across Africa that either seek to complement or support the development of the Wikipedia project in Africa. The added quality these different cases present will be analysed in the light of the findings of Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3.  Part of this phase is also the identification of the aspects that could be improved in OCS initiatives relying on the Wikipedia framework to make content more relevant and accessible for African readers in order to translate greater accessibility into greater usefulness for specific development issues.\n\nThrough the implementation of the above research design this study aims at contributing to the objective of the OCSDNet, and assisting existing and new initiatives in achieving the Lyon Declaration on Access to Information and Development (August 2014). The research could, potentially, create a framework to better understand the conceptual and practical conditions under which OCS approaches can lead to successful development in Africa.', 'Sustainable development is tied to the long-term socio-economic prosperity and well-being of all people. This achievement of long-term prosperity is threatened by the inability of state and non-state actors to make informed decisions. Wikipedia’s current inability to fulfil its true potential perpetuates the mass media systems within the population of each African country. \n\nThe potential of having free-access to locally-relevant, updated (and updatable) neutral information on any given subject is immense. The outcomes of this exhaustive research into the context, challenges, behaviours and opportunities of Wikipedia and the Open movement in Africa would move beyond the UN Millennium Development Goals to embracing the principles of the Lyon Declaration on Access to Information and Development (August 2014). \n\nAreas where development potential can be enhanced by access to locally-relevant knowledge include, but are not limited to health knowledge, civil society support, equalising political  engagement, citizen empowerment, Human Rights advocacy, and education support and extension.\n\nThe expected and measurable outcomes of this project include:\nPhase 1:\n1. Provide an innovative analytical framework derived from existing theories from the Global South relating to knowledge and development for engagement by future developmental and knowledge projects wishing to work in th Global South.\n2. Provide practical, theoretically-sound background and context for projects willing to embrace the principles of the Lyon Declaration on Access to Information and Development (August 2014).\n\nPhase 2: \n1. Provide a clear online map of Wikipedia and aligned Open activities across the African continent. \n2. Create a rubric and methodology for assessing country and development content of articles in Wikipedia related sources on the basis of an in-depth analysis of the methodologies and successes of particular projects across Africa’s Open landscape.\n3. Provide a proposed list of essential articles to be created on 3 language Wikipedias in order to fully cover 6 countries and their specific development landscapes.\n4. Strengthen the continental Wikipedians and Open network and initiatives by formalising the network of Open activists and supporting collaborative research between Wikimedia, OSN and University Open knowledge projects across Africa. \n\nPhase 3: \n1. Provide researched analysed Open-licenced data about online and mobile usage, habits and behaviour across a range of populations and socio-economic contexts.\n2. Publish cross-cultural findings on the consumption of Open Knowledge across Africa published in Open journals.\n3. Provide suggestions and guidelines for developmental projects wishing to engage with mobile and online citizens across Africa.\n\nPhase 4:\n1. Minimum of 4 papers published in Open journals on the research findings.\n2. Presentations of the research and subsequent findings at the annual Wiki Indaba and Wikimania conferences over the next 3 years.\n3. Provide a clear framework for incorporating theoretical engagement with the processes and paradigms of knowledge production into future Open projects and the work of development workers.\n4. Identify areas of hidden challenges within the developmental community that could potentially be resolved or mitigated by access to locally-relevant and developmentally-specific information.', 'The monitoring and evaluation plan for the project will analyse the lessons, accountability, effectiveness of strategy and management, and the suitability and long-term impact of its outcomes relating to the stakeholders. \n1.

(87, 'Dr. Mihayo Musabila Maguta holds a BSc. in Chemistry and Statistics, Msc. in environmental Science and PhD in environmental Chemistry. His PhD research work was based on experimental work to assess a technology which is used in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Thus he has a very good understanding of the climate change issues including sources and contributions of greenhouse gases on climate change. Also he has attended a professional training in Germany on energy issues including production of biogas. As a research officer at TIRDO he has conducted a lot of energy and environmental audits aiming at reducing pollutions from the industries and minimising energy consumption. \nThe innovation which is going to be implemented in this project is new to Tanzania but has been implemented in other countries including India. The technology is simple and just needs a combination of skills from chemists, environmental scientists, food scientists and energy engineers to be implemented.\nThe additional expertise to be brought in by the research collaborators will be in the fields of food, biogas digester construction as well as energy. Ms. Sarah Lifa from TIRDO and Dr. Towo from TFNC are well experienced food scientists who will be responsible for training on hygiene issues and testing the quality of the produced spirulina for its suitability for human consumption. Furthermore they will be responsible for providing awareness seminars on the importance of spirulina as a food supplement to combat malnutrition in children as well as a health booster in adults due to its high nutrition value. Ms. Jacqueline Mwendwa is a chemist and environmental scientist will contribute on monitoring the environmental aspects pertaining to this project. Dr. Lugano Wilson is an expert energy engineer at TIRDO will be responsible for ensuring that the constructed bio-digesters are of good design as well as optimization of the process to ensure that enough biogas is produced as intended. Dr. Mjema from CAMARTEC has extensive experience in developing rural technologies, including designing and installation of bio-digester. His institution has trained more than 101 Tanzanians and 41 foreigners on how to construct biogas plants, hence they will be responsible for construction and installations of the bio-digesters. In addition, CAMARTEC has been involved in the biogas dissemination programmes and subsequent (national and international) training and promotion. Over the past 2 decades, CAMARTEC has established itself as a centre for biogas with an excellent reputation. On the other hand, both organisations (TFNC and CAMARTEC) have a history of working with the Tanzanian rural community who are the target project beneficiaries. \nIn short, CAMARTEC has a vast experience in installations of bio-digesters for biogas production while TIRDO and TFNC have well experienced food scientists who will combine their knowledge with the energy engineers, chemists and environmental scientists both from TIRDO and CAMARTEC in the production of spirulina, bio-fertilizer and biogas.', 'Production of spirulina, biogas and bio-fertilizer for rural community livelihood improvement in Tanzania', 'Tanzania', 'Local communities in Tanzania are faced by a number of problems including food security, malnutrition, sources of clean energy and deforestation that may trigger catastrophic problems like climatic change. It is envisaged that by carrying out a project on the integrated system known as biomethanation, the above problems will be minimized. Biomethanation is a process whereby biomass is fed to digesters producing carbon dioxide which is used in ponds to produce spirulina at the same time methane gas is produced leaving behind the bio-slurry which is further converted to bio-fertiliser. \nThe Tanzania Industrial Research and Development Organisation (TIRDO) in collaboration with Tanzania Food and Nutrition Centre (TFNC) [an organisation responsible for scaling up nutrition services (SUN) in the country with the aim of reducing all forms of malnutrition,] and Center for Mechanization and Rural Technologies (CAMARTEC) [responsible for the production of rural technologies] intend to help communities with malnutrition problems to build up Spirulina growth ponds which will make provision of the high protein food supplement thereby tackling the problem of food security as well as improving the health of children, and in the course of doing that an integrated system of bio-digesters and ethanol production units capable of providing entire communities with clean burning cooking fuel, bio-fertilizer and renewable energy that can generate electricity can be operated. This would also generate employment opportunities at the same time be in line with the millennium development goals 1,  reduction of extreme hunger and poverty, 3, gender equality and women empowerment  and 4, reduction of child mortality. It can be rewarding to work with TFNC as regards to nutritional issues based on their extensive experience in effective coordination of nutrition activities in Tanzania, the priority areas among many others being a) infant and young children feeding and b) maternal and child malnutrition. The same would apply to CAMARTEC which has extensive experience in developing rural technologies, geographically; the Center has trained more than 101 Tanzanians and 41 foreigners on how to construct biogas plants. CAMARTEC has been involved in the biogas dissemination programmes and subsequent (national and international) training and promotion. Over the past 2 decades, CAMARTEC has established itself as a centre for biogas with an excellent reputation. On the other hand, both organisations (TFNC and CAMARTEC) have a history of working with the Tanzanian rural community. The collaboration with the two organisations first will be to identify which key needs of the rural community can be addressed before adapting newly developed technologies and second, what high-margin consumer goods can be produced and distributed whose revenues can be used to keep the costs of sustainable community and environmental benefits affordable. Dissemination of technology will be done by demonstrations and the mechanism for sharing information will be through media, meetings, workshops, reports and mass mobilization, taking advantage of TIRDO who have a mandate of carrying out industrial research, TFNC who has the mission to promote nutrition of the socio-economical deprived and nutritionally vulnerable groups as well as community participation in managing and controlling nutritional problems in the country and lastly CARMATEC who are pioneers in biogas plants.', 'The project will have two working packages as indicated below:\nWP1: Production of biogas and spirulina\nBio-digesters will be designed and constructed by experts from CAMARTEC in accordance to the estimated amount of biogas to be produced depending on the size of the population to be served. Biogas will be produced using cow-dung as raw material. Some additional organic waste can be added to boost the process in case the deemed necessary to optimize the biogas production system. \nThe produced biogas contains mainly methane and carbon dioxide. Methane will be used for cooking activities which potential for electricity generation as well. The produced carbon dioxide will be used for production of spirulina. The production of spirulina will follow the procedure as detailed by Mondal and Mukherjee, 2010, Gami et al, 2011). \nWP2: Production of biofertilizer\nThe bio-slurry which is the by-product of the biogas production system will be converted to bio-fertilizer which can be used for agricultural activities to increase the soil fertility and hence high yield in agricultural produces.', 'Biomethanation process which is the main target of the project is a viable business which can create sustainable employment, income and establish profitable supply chain for feeding, cooking gas supply, renewable and climatichange mitigation programmes.\nApart from generation of income to the producers, biomethanation  will play a big role in the war against malnutrition which will reduce child mortality thereby strengthening the future workforce of the country.\nAnother developmental impact is that, currently the major source of energy both in rural and urban areas in Tanzania is biomass mainly firewood and charcoal which contributes much on felling trees. Therefore the biogas produced in the project will be used for cooking thereby preserving the trees which are one of the main sinks of the prime greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO2). Health-wise, the use of biogas in cooking activities will distance women and children who spent longer times in the kitchen from the exposure of toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide as well as particulate matter which are dangerous to human health.\nApart from cooking activities, the produced biogas can be promoted for generation of electricity which will ultimately provoke more development in rural areas and hence improving the living standards of the poor.\nOrganic fertilizer produced also will be a source of income to the people involved in the project. Applications of this organic fertilizer will ultimately increase the agricultural produces for both food and cash crops thereby enabling farmers to have enough food and more money from the cash crops as well as from sold surplus of the food crops. Use of the organic fertilizer in horticultural activities will not only enable farmers to save money which they normally spend on buying expensive chemical fertilizers but also will lead to high yield, hence more income generation and hence poverty reduction.\nIt is also anticipated that, the availability of cheap organic fertilizer will catalyse the establishment of horticultural plantations in rural areas which will definitely accelerate the economic growth of the poor rural communities\nThe key implementers of this project will be women since they also have important role of taking care of their families and children particularly in rural areas. The project will not only provide a long term solution to combat malnutrition in the country but also will provide an opportunity to overcoming several of the most challenging needs of rural communities in Tanzania, such as renewable energy, clean-burning cooking fuel, organic fertilizer and employment opportunities leaving aside the climate change mitigation aspect embeded within the project context. Therefore, the success of this project will make a difference towards achieving Millennium Development Goals, 1 (extreme hunger and poverty eradication), 3 (women empowerment) and 4 (child mortality reduction).', 'The project monitoring will be conducted for the entire period of the project to ensure that the system is working properly to avoid any kind of abnormalities which may lead to negative effects. These will include regular check-up of the biogas production and the whole system to avoid any leakage of of methane which can lead to fire explosions. Also methane is the greenhouse gas with very high global warming potential, thus its emission to the atmosphere has to be avoided. The bio-slurry from the system has to be well monitored to avoid it being a source of pathogens which can lead to outbreak of diseases. The hygene in the spirulina production ponds will be regularly monitored to ensure high quality of the food supplement. Evaluation will be conducted at the mid of the project to assess the progress of the project on achieving the targeted goals so as optimization measures can be taken whenever necessary to ensure that the system is working properly and generating enough biogas and spirulina.

Compile and assess existing scientific and observational (i.e. local knowledge) data of ecological and biophysical status and socioeconomics of resource use (for fishing, tourism, aquaculture, and subsistence) and changes over time for two coastal case study areas: Rayong and Trat Provinces in Thailand; and Pream Krasop Wildlife Sanctuary/Koh Kong Province in Cambodia. Formulate hypotheses of the critical linkages among ecological, biophysical, social, governmental, economic drivers using a Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework for each study area.</p><p>2. Use geovisualization methodologies to develop a GIS based vulnerability assessment of the coastal region within these case studies. Deliver a visually engaging spatial model and map of impact, threats, and vulnerability that strongly influence system resilience to climate change, from which to identify a focus for adaptation activities.</p><p>3. Engagement of key stakeholders including local case study communities in filling gaps in data and through the innovative visual method, photovoice, to identify perceptions of change, barriers, and priorities for the future adaptation. Outcomes are the basis for adaptation planning.</p><p>4. Scientific team workshops at intervals to share and consolidate knowledge and communicate across disciplines and cultures using conceptual models to reduce complexity and stimulate interdisciplinary thinking. We will synthesise findings to identify common themes and processes among the two study sites to improve planning for resilience within the study sites with implications for coastal systems worldwide.</p><p>5. Using web-based technology, to disseminate through a visually engaging report with presentations tailored appropriately for influential scientists, politicians, and policy-makers as well as participating local communities in each case study country. Co-authored scientific papers will be prepared for publication and contribution to country IPCC assessment reports.</p><p>To accomplish these goals, we will convene workshops to enable open and collaborative science. Two five day workshops will focus on each of the two study sites in turn in eastern Thailand and western Cambodia. These two coastal systems will serve as case studies to evaluate the drivers of resilience in two systems with similarly rich ecological and biophysical conditions but different governance, and socio-economic structures.</p><p>Using existing and compiled datasets from these representative sites, we will refine an existing conceptual model of the reciprocal natural and human factors that strongly influence system resilience (Day 1), evaluate the linkages between these disparate parameters using innovative data visualization technology (Days 2 and 3). Days 4 and 5 will be used to integrate results and write a manuscript that summarizes the results from each workshop, describing the key drivers within that system and the reciprocal nature of resilience within each system.</p><p>A third workshop will take a synthetic and comparative approach, to identify common themes and processes among the two study sites to ensure that the work conducted can be used to improve resilience within the study sites as well as in coastal systems worldwide.</p>', '<p>The work outlined above will generate:</p><p>(i) an expert-vetted integrated conceptual model of resilience based on data collected from the research sites;</p><p>(ii) a novel qualitative assessment matrix that captures expert and local knowledge from multiple scientific domains across the model development process;</p><p>(iii) a publication documenting the data review and model development activities;</p><p>(iv) a project-specific website on which the model will be posted along with annotated descriptions of the datasets and meta-data; and</p><p>(v) policy advice to the governments of Thailand and Cambodia of implications of developing a cross-border Marine Protected Area or Biosphere Reserve.</p><p>These products will advance theoretical discovery by the scientific community and will be made available to interested practitioners and policymakers publically through our website and social media outreach. This model will also serve as the starting point for our stepwise approach to refinement and validation.</p><p>Further, it will provide new spatial data on resilience derived from stakeholder expertise and participatory mapping, leading to the refinement of the DPSIR frameworks for each study site. Data layers, map output and Federal Geographic Data Committee compliant metadata will be provided to each participating organization. These products will allow stakeholders in Thailand and Cambodia to integrate and visualize data, which is highly important for effective and integrative resource management and sustainable development. These maps, along with our refined conceptual models, will be made publicly available on our project website and published to document the process and report on our results.</p><p>Our approach represents a new model for resilience research by combining expertise across human and natural disciplines with local knowledge expressed through visualization technologies as input into an integrated conceptual model. This research will expand the role of these technologies to serve as a platform for data integration and visualization and will facilitate the creation of novel common and comparative approaches to combine disparate data types from the social and natural sciences.</p><p>The novel comparative framework that we will develop will model the effects of complex coastal processes on resilience and will lead to new approaches to sustainable management of the land-sea interface in tropical areas. This model will be broadly applicable to other coastal areas and will serve as the foundation for a decision support framework that integrates tropical marine and terrestrial processes along rapidly changing coastlines.</p><p>Our project will generate open collaborative research on coastal resilience that, due to our involvement with local stakeholders and agencies, will directly lead to actionable science, that is, scholarship with the direct potential to improve the design and implementation of public policies and to influence public and/or private sector strategies and planning.</p>', '<p>This project will create a critically-needed approach using innovative technology and data integration approaches to advance tropical coastal resilience and resource management.</p><p>We will generate a visualization methodology that will enable scientists and managers to work together to advance coastal resilience and resource management, introduce new technological applications and bridge the gap between natural and social science to understand structure, functioning, and sustainability of socio-environmental systems. Immediate measures of success include:</p><p>1) the effective use of the interdisciplinary DPSIR framework as a way of bridging the natural and social science gap</p><p>2) the integrative products from the web-based visualization exercises,</p><p>3) attendee surveys, and</p><p>4) peer review and comments on submitted articles. To monitor, measure, and evaluate progress, we will conduct participatory summative and formative evaluations regularly throughout the project period.</p><p>For each objective, the Principal Researcher (PR) and Research Collaborators (RC&rsquo;s) will oversee formative assessments of the specific activities conducted, i.e., anonymous surveys of team members and stakeholders regarding the focus, structure, and products to identify necessary changes as the project develops.</p><p>The surveys will also be used to evaluate the progress and success in accomplishing each of the individual objectives and related activities. Based on these evaluations, the PR and RC&rsquo;s will assess progress in meeting research goals and objectives, will collect benchmark information, and adjust procedures in case of unexpected developments.</p><p>The PR and members of the research team will review data gathered from the formative assessments at bi-quarterly project meetings and will then adjust tasks and objectives as needed. Toward the end of the project, we will conduct a summative evaluation to assess the impact of the project. We look forward to using emerging impact evaluation tools such as outcome harvesting and ImpactStory to engage all project participants, including team members, workshop participants, policy makers and community.</p><p>The evaluation will focus on assessing: the success of the workshops; the scientific deliverables; accessibility of the science to managers and planners; and the utility of the decision support system in influencing practice and learning.</p><p>This summative assessment will also determine how goals and objectives were met, major challenges and impediments to progress and how the project advanced open and collaborative resilience research.</p>', '$79,300.00 CAD', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/letter_of_endorsement_OCSD_Net_Dr_Suvaluck.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudgetTemplate_ss.xlsx', 136, 251, 'complete', 'yes', 1411160712, 'complete', 'This proposal is well developed. The rationale, objectives, and methods are clear. And I can see how the results of the project could help us think about the infrastructure and methods that could be useful for promoting OSCDNet. The biggest concern that I have about the proposal is that a substantial porportion, if not most, of the budget is spent on international travelling of experts from the UK, USA, Austratlia and Canada. While I am sure the money wlll be well spent, I wonder if the modes of exchanges, as well as the methods of building the integrated framework, could be done diffirently so that there is more budget for the involvement of other actors on the ground.

(89, 'We are backed by almost ten years dedicated to research respect to Human Rights in digital environments. Sponsored by several institutions we have done plenty of research on access to knowledge, privacy and freedom of expression in Chile and in the region. Danae Tapia, the project leader has experience on qualitative methods as in discourse analysis, Juan Carlos Lara, head of research has a vast trajectory on legal research, he leads the research area at Derechos Digitales, Pablo Cárcamo is sociologist and he has experience on social sciences research, he has worked in subjects as open access and quantitative methods.', 'Mapping academic practices and perceptions in South America towards a pro-open environment', 'Chile, Argentina, Perú, Colombia', 'The project will conduct research to learn how institutional frameworks, both of regulatory nature as well as common practice, dictate how scientific work is carried out, in relation to research institutions and to the scientific and academic communities more broadly.\nOur hypothesis for this project is that there are structural conditions in the way that scientific labour is conducted in Chile, that introduces a high degree of uncertainty and thus affects the possibilities of developing attitudes favorable to open science and collaboration, especially in an international context. We propose a materialistic approach to the subject of open and collaborative science that is necessary for understanding the specific dynamics of science in Latin America. We are certain that any initiative that aims to foster open and collaborative science needs to be rooted in the way scientists conduct their everyday work.\nPart of this situation has already been reported in a different study (Promotion of open knowledge in the Chilean academia: “Attitudes And Perceptions Of The Scientific Publication System In Chilean Researchers“), centered around Open Access journals publication, in which one of the conclusions is that, in spite of growing numbers of national publication of open access journals, the so called “scientific capital” of traditional journals makes it hard to publish in newer, OA journals, while there is no requirement or incentive to make scientific data available for use elsewhere. This research explores the perceptions on the circuit of production and circulation of scientific knowledge of consolidated Chilean academics (researchers with high rates of publication and citation) through a qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews. That research also gave us a first impression on the scientist’s justifications regarding Open Access, where democratization of science and the speed of scientific work were given as favorable aspects of OA publication. It is difficult to find deeper arguments to justify Open Access as a moral imperative within scientific communities.\nA broader, national survey that delivers information on scientists’ way of thinking is a natural step forward in those efforts. By conducting a national survey we will be able to identify the main variables linked to the conditions that correlate with positive or negative attitudes and perceptions towards open and collaborative scientific work. Also we will be able to get more information on collaborative practices and attitudes, which will be helpful for delivering awareness campaigns on the benefits of openness, and recommendations to public and private research institutions and publishers. These results will provide a framework to work on qualitative research in other south cone countries.\nFor instance, issues like government incentives, legal or institutional mandates, or publicly funded fellowship requirements might determine attitudes and practical scientific work. Also, more immediately pressing issues such as job insecurity, low salaries or discomfort with universities’ management could predict negative attitudes towards open science. On the other hand, other variables like age, gender or geographic location might correlate better with the attitudes towards open and collaborative science.\nWe believe that our approach will inject a theoretical and practical way of understanding scientist’s motivations, practices and attitudes towards open and collaborative science that is replicable in many countries of the Global South.', 'The project is designed to proceed in different stages. The first stage of the project will address the context for the research, in order to assess the conditions under which scientific research is carried out in Chile. This involves both analysis of regulatory conditions, by which we mean, the framework under which science operates legally, institutionally, and regarding public policy, and which of those has an impact in openness or collaboration schemes. This will also collect data on indicators of evaluation of the country’s production in research products, especially science literature.\nThe second stage is the core instrument of the project, which will provide a mapping of main incentives and ideologies regarding collaborative work and openness in science, both within a national context as well as considering variables of openness and networking at an international level. This will be carried out through an open process to develop the core instrument of our project. The survey will be developed in a three-step process: a) Our research team delivers a first draft of the survey to a panel of national scientists for feedback; b) The second draft, containing the commentaries of national scientists, is released in a collaborative document on the Web for further feedback; c) Our research team analyses the commentaries received and delivers a final survey draft. To reach a national audience of scientists we will rely on information provided by CONICYT (the public institution that coordinates, promotes and encourages scientific and technological research in Chile) and engage scientists using social media, thus increasing our probabilities to reach a representative number of responses. Sample representativeness will be calculated once we close access to the survey and collect all the possible answers. Once the data is nicely ordered and categorized we will release it as soon as possible, so everybody who wants to contribute to the analysis can do it. We will establish firm relationships to people who want to contribute and credit them officially for their contributions. This will lead to preliminary conclusions.\nA third stage will bring about qualitative research within scientific communities in countries most likely to interact with Chilean researchers from a regional perspective. This will point out to set the stage for future research, of qualitative nature in the same fashion as the proposed second stage at national level, in order to obtain better information regarding institutional and regulatory incentives. We will cover countries with different legal frameworks respect to open science in order to compare perceptions and routines, then we will develop a set of recommendations differentiated depending on the contexts but with a regional perspective.', '1. A deep analysis of the current situation of institutional incentives towards openness and collaboration, including legal frameworks and considering previous research. This will allow a clear view of contextual conditions that might affect the outcomes of collaboration and openness, allowing its comparison to other contexts.\n2. An analysis of the main problems towards establishing a culture of openness and collaboration in science.\n3. A set of proposals, directed towards both policymakers in government as well as standard good practice initiatives for science and research institutions. This will provide a context-specific response that, given the groundwork and tools of analysis, will also try to provide some keys to extend collaboration schemes not only on a national level, but also with international ties.\n4. A set of data and visualisation tools.', 'From a research perspective, success is to be measured by the amount and quality of responses on a national level, and the proper validation of the survey by relevant members of the scientific process, through an assessment table for all relevant stakeholders and a logframe for all relevant steps. Also, relevant researchers will be consulted quarterly regarding the advances of the project and their most important concerns about the research work and objectives.\nImpact of the research results will be further obtained by a proper media campaign and followup of the reach of each publication within six months. Feedback from all eventual readers will be sought.\nWhile a set of proposals will be drafted, consulted, corrected and published, its impact in the long term will only be measurable by the adoption of the proposals, in part or in whole, in certain institutions and/or communities.', '74766', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/Endorsement_letter_OCSDnet1.PDF', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudget_DD.xlsx', 191, 254, 'complete', 'yes', 1411168821, 'complete', 'This is the most conventional proposal in the lot I received.

For Santos, cognitive injustice &ldquo;underlies all the other dimensions; global social justice is not possible without global cognitive justice&rdquo;.</p><p>In other words, no real development will be possible as long as the &ldquo;knowledges&rdquo; produced in the Global South remain marginalized, despised, ignored, not taken seriously by science in the Global North, assimilated to folklore or to local and therefore partial perpectives. Yet, these knowledges are precious, intrinsically, as a source of inspiration, solve local problems, or generate innovations. Their diversity widens the range of possibilities within science or in public life.</p><p>Some of these knowledges come from tradition or culture, others from political or environmental experiences or as a result of adapting to new conditions. One hypothesis is that Open and Collaborative Science (OCS) is a tool able to transform the power relation between science produced in the Global North and the knowledges from the Global South because it aims to make all knowledges more visible, more accessible, and shared within a renewed &ldquo;science commons&rdquo;. OCS ideals, notably that of establishing greater cognitive justice, can be opposed to a more hierarchical &ldquo;Ivory Tower&rdquo; view of science. OCS is therefore more likely to benefit civil society. However, there are many obstacles, especially in the less developed countries of French-speaking Africa and in Haiti (FSAH) which share a lot of cultural, economic and social characteristics. In particular, in FSAH universities, scare resources make OCS appears a luxury.</p><p>Our project starts from the opposite point of view and considers that OCS can become an efficient tool to help universities become the sustainable development agents that they can, and should be, in each country.</p><p>The main research objective of our project is to document, in a realistic and precise way, the potential and obstacles to the adoption of OCS practices in FSAH universities, especially among graduate students. We will test 2 assumptions.</p><p>The first one is that OCS could empower FSAH universities, notably through 2 tools: institutional repositories and science shops.</p><p>The second one is that a low level of Digital Scientific Literacy (DSL) among FSAH researchers and graduate student may limit that possibility.</p><p>By DSL, we mean the ability to use, in an optimal way and without any fear or mistrust, all the possibilities of the scientific Internet, including open access journals, institutional repositories, scientific networks, social media, collaborative documents, blogs or free databases. Our project will also generate training tools in OCS adapted to local conditions and a network of local leaders in OCS. We have already started to build such a core network with our international team formed of senior researchers, graduate students and external advisors in library science, anthropology, communication, geography and philosophy from Algeria, Belgium, Benin, Burkina, Burundi, Canada, Chad, Germany, Haiti, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger and Senegal.</p><p>Each researcher based in FSAH will become the local correspondent of that network and promote OCS and cognitive justice in their institution, in the spirit of the Open Science groups of the Open Knowledge Foundation Network. Our first objective explores the Theme 1 in the OCSDnet call.</p><p>Phase 1 will consist in a protocol of participatory research-action. We will use interviews, participant observation and questionnaires in order to identify how a pro-open environment might be created within at least 10 FSAH universities. We will also test our digital scientific literacy assumption and identify local leaders in OCS at the same time.</p><p>Phase 2 will take in two main interventions. The first one will be the local creation of training tools in OCS in answer to the identified difficulties. Our second intervention aims to test our assumptions about the possible benefits for FSAH of 2 OCS tools that are valued in the Global North OCS community:</p><p>1) participatory institutional repositories of scientific publications and</p><p>2) science shops providing independent, usually free participatory research support in response to concerns experienced by civil society.</p><p>Phase 3 will be dedicated to the collective analysis of the data and of our team experience in order to draw a global roadmap for OCS dissemination in FSAH. This roadmap will benefit from the constitution of a valuable community of OCS leaders in FSAH (Theme 3).</p>', '<p>Our research design is based on our team&rsquo;s expertise and resources (see section 1). We will use them according to the OCS ideal of recycling sustaining research tools and outputs. Our principal investigator will be based in Dakar. Six part-time research assistants in different countries will help her lead the project. We will also invite OCS specialists from English-speaking African countries (i.e Cape Town science shop) and Latin America (CLACSO) as mentors and advisers.</p><p>The project inception phase (January-February 2015) will finalize the research methodology and establish a strong team operating across 13 countries using virtual meetings (Skype, Google hangout, Big Blue Button). We will select our open source communication tools and ensure that we share the same OCS ideals and levels of digital scientific literacy. We will continue to use virtual meetings once a month throughout the project. A Wordpress website will be set up especially for the project and all team members will learn how to administer it. Phase 1 (March &ndash; November 2015) will be dedicated to testing our assumptions about the low level of digital open scientific literacy in FSAH.</p><p>We will collect data about digital scientific literacy, publication practices and perception of open science among graduate students, professors, and university administrators in up to 10 universities of FSAH (Senegal, Mali, Niger, Burkina, Chad, Ivory Coast, Benin, Burundi, Haiti). In situ members of our team will act as local principal investigators.</p><p>The proposed data collection tools will be participant observation and individual semi-directed interviews (filmed and not filmed). With the collaboration of Association des universit&eacute;s francophones, a web survey using an already published questionnaire will also be implemented. These interventions will have a pedagogical benefit since they may introduce OCS to some participants. The expected outcome is a mapping of OCS practices, focusing on its potential and limitations.</p><p>Phase 2 (November 2015 &ndash; June 2016) will consists in two main interventions.</p><p>- First, the local creation of training tools in OCS in response to difficulties identified during Phase 1. Inspired by the Khan academy&rsquo;s work, short videos could easily be made with mobile phones or open source software by members of the team or their undergraduate students. They could film African researchers, men and women, describing OCS and using OCS tools such as repositories, open access databases, open source software, etc.</p><p>- Second, testing our assumptions about the possible benefits for FSAH of two OCS tools that are valued in the Global North OCS community:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1) participatory institutional repositories of scientific publications and</p><p>2) science shops providing independent, usually free participatory research support in response to concerns experienced by civil society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although both tools are at present underdeveloped and probably widely unknown in FSAH (though not in English-speaking Africa), they could empower FSAH towards greater cognitive justice. Our intervention will consist in organizing at least five formal and informal group discussions in each institution about the desirability and feasibility of both OCD tools for FSAH. Public presentations of existing (African) institutional repository and science shops will be organized by our team members.</p><p>The targeted population will be mainly graduate students and junior researchers in each institution, but also university administrators. All the raw data from these interventions will be published on the Web, through the publication of our collective &ldquo;open fieldwork notebooks&rdquo;, a technique inspired by Jean-Claude Bradley&#39;s lab innovation. These online open source notebooks will welcome comments from readers and collaborative writing. Some partial analyses could be published in the journal Science ouverte.</p><p>The aim of these interventions is to document the potential and limitations of both OCS tools in each country. They will also allow us to identify potential OCS leaders and build a network. A free newsletter on OCS in FSAH will be launched, fed by notes and papers from the network thus created. Phase 3 (July 2016 &ndash; December 2016) will be dedicated to the collective analysis of the data and of our team experience in order to draw a global roadmap for OCS dissemination in FSAH.</p><p>The network of OCS local leaders built during the first year will be involved in developing and endorsing this roadmap. At the end of the project (December 2016), a conference will be held in Dakar (Senegal) in order to disseminate our results and submit our roadmap to public debate. It will be filmed and put online. It will also lead to the collective publication of open access papers and possibly a collective e-book. The results from the ongoing monitoring and evaluation will also be published.</p>', '<p>As shown by de Sousa Santos and others, cognitive injustice is a strong obstacle to development since it collectively disempowers citizens by making them undervalue their own knowledges and capacities. The long term outcome we wish to achieve through our project is a reversal of this situation in FSAH by improving cognitive justice. Our intermediate outcome will be to generate in several FSAH universities, notably among graduate students and junior researchers, a renewed trust in their ability to become agents of change and development on their own terms, within their own culture and using their local science and knowledges.</p><p>Far from being a luxury, OCS is a very effective and efficient tool. Indeed, we assume that OCS has the potential to increase the visibility and dissemination of local knowledges, as well as fulfilling the researchers&rsquo; wish to connect more with colleagues and with civil society, notably through open access and science shops. But we also assume that in order to have that impact, the level of scientific digital literacy must be raised in FSAH universities.</p><p>Our 3 interventions will generate short-term outcomes that will help to refine these assumptions:</p><p>1) A mapping of publication practices and perception of OCS, focusing on its potential and limitations, in at least 10 universities of FSAH.</p><p>2) The local creation of training tools in OCS that could be of use to all FSAH researchers thanks to their dissemination through social networks.</p><p>3) An analysis of the potential and limitations of two OCS tools (institutional repository and science shop) in these universities.</p><p>4) The creation of a network of potential OCS leaders in FSAH, linked through a website and a newsletter.</p><p>5) A road map for empowering OSC in French-Speaking Africa and Haiti, endorsed at final conference, published on website and shared with 10 opinion-forming and funding organisations.</p><p>According to our Theory of Change, these short-term outcomes will enable FSAH university authorities and international networks make better informed decisions about their support to the OCS movement, including OCSDNet.</p><p>Our work will prevent FSAH universities from remaining excluded from this international movement because of their lack of resources and weak Web infrastructure. On the contrary, it will generate a realistic roadmap towards an empowering OCS in FSAH, making local knowledges and capacities more visible and disseminated through either an institutional repository or a science shop, or through other OCS by-products. We assume that local innovation, adapted to local challenges and contributing to sustainable development, will be generated as a result of the renewed trust in FSAH researchers&rsquo; own capacity to produce knowledge.</p><p>Our project will also empower team members. Prof Diouf will be able to develop her concept of a participatory institutional repository for FSAH. All researchers will engage in new international collaborations and discover new ways of doing science and social studies of science. One risk is that they turn into a new local scientific elite. Our collective ethos, use of open tools and belief in cognitive justice will mitigate against this unplanned negative outcome.</p>', '<p>Core team motivation Multinational team effectiveness will be measured by</p><p>1) Number of core team members participating in monthly virtual meetings.

His research has been developed mainly in three areas: 1) Epistemology and philosophy of science and technology; 2) Analysis of intercultural relations (political, social, ethical cultural, political, and); 3) Study of the relationship between science, technology and society, including ethical issues in science and technology. He is currently director of the Research Seminar on Knowledge Society and Cultural Diversity (created in 2009) of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (http://www.diversidadcultural.unam.mx/ and http://www.sociedadconocimiento.unam.mx/). \nWithin the seminar have developed several projects focused on the preservation of cultural heritage and material groups that have been excluded from the benefits of economic and social development, as indigenous peoples, rural and farmers communities. Besides traditional articulate scientific and technological knowledge in productive practices of knowledge communities, to contribute to the resolution of specific problems and social development in a sustainable and respectful of local cultures and the environment, strengthening the appreciation and respect of cultural diversity, with special emphasis on the appreciation of the wealth of traditional knowledge as well as their promotion and protection.\nIn this sense, projects and research has been developed by an interdisciplinary group with expertise in topics related to scientific and technological knowledge and traditional knowledge where different communication channels with indigenous and non-indigenous communities, academics, social organizations, government agencies open and the general public. Among the projects are:\n1) Mexican traditional knowledge portal: a challenge to intellectual property issues, cultural diversity and social justice.

Noteworthy that the team has participated in the development of the above described projects, which have been successfully completed, obtaining the expected results. In this sense, the team is organized to solve theoretical and practical problems, and who have worked in various communities in the country, mainly in the states of Oaxaca, Michoacan and Guerrero. In this project, we will address the Mixe region of Oaxaca, where previously already established relationships with the leaders of the population and are informed of the progress of the project; and the identification of the actors in context.', 'Educational innovation and social appropriation of knowledge. A model for science education in intercultural contexts', 'Mexico', 'The recognition of Mexico as a multicultural and multilingual country (1992) raises the need for intercultural education for entire Mexican population and an important means to improve practices in all levels of education challenge. The proposal presented here aims to contribute to establishing of an intercultural approach through the development of innovative strategies based on the use of technological resources in science education. The aim is to design and develop an educational model for the collective creation of materials that contribute to the recognition and appreciation of cultural diversity in secondary education, based on collaborative work practices mediated by technology resources. Study plans established from recent educational reforms try to give all Mexicans training based on skills development oriented recognition and appreciation of the cultural diversity of our country, as the fundamental basis for coexistence between members of the different cultural groups in Mexico. Therefore, this project is focused on (T3) of this call because it seeks to answer some questions: What are the pathways for how new knowledge generated by OCS is learned, shared and communicated? and What is the relationship between OCS and science education?\nIn this case, in order to answer these questions, we place ourselves in basic secondary education. All programs of the subjects try to include some topics related to intercultural education. Since 2009, the research group has made this project presents a diagnostic study in primary and secondary schools from the states of Mexico and Guerrero, showing some of the advantages of addressing the recognition of cultural diversity in teaching science, and not just specific content subjects such as civics and ethics, history or geography. First, in discussing matters of science and technology, it is possible to see how members of different groups are integrated into a multicultural society confronts many social and environmental problems at the local, regional and national levels, the solution depends on the possibilities to develop innovations that build on the knowledge available to the sustainable development of a more just and democratic society.nd, in science subjects is possible to highlight the social character of science and technology, and social practices based on dialogue and critical analysis of knowledge, and recognizing the role of individuals and communities in the processes of the generation, evaluation and appropriation of knowledge. Third, the teaching of science provides a suitable space to recognize the importance of scientific and technological culture as part of citizenship education intervention in discussions of issues related to science and technology. \nThe result of these educational practices maintain social exclusion schemes that in the long term lead to the loss of traditional knowledge, cultural erosion, loss of indigenous languages ??and the presence of discriminatory practices against members of indigenous groups. One of the factors contributing to this situation is the lack of materials and resources for use in specific contexts. Therefore, in the field of intercultural education is a priority to establish a number of new educational materials, each set to each cultural context, which justifies the need for the cooperation and participation of all stakeholders in the process.\nThe information technology and communication (ICT) offer countless opportunities for content development and educational activities. Moreover, the application allows to design new teaching and teaching and teaching materials and resources which provide interesting developments in the education systems methodologies. This requires considering ICT not only as communication resources or tools to solve problems, but as cognitive elements that transform the relations of production and exchange of knowledge and promote various forms of expression of individual and collective identity. From this perspective, the role of ICT is not limited to providing information management tools, it offers models of cognitive agency oriented collaborative production and exchange of knowledge that are directly associated with the formation of learning communities.\nImportantly, the methodology of open and collaborative production also promotes the recognition and appreciation of the skills of the participants, such as the possession of an indigenous language and the use of various learning strategies developed within their social context. This cognitive perspective of ICT can meet the requirements of a system of intercultural education that exceed the mere transmission of content, including by requiring the training of students as active agents in the assessment, generation and communication of knowledge that occurs in context specific. The results of this proposal will provide the methodological and practical bases for the creation of culturally relevant materials, introducing an innovative working model that encourages the exchange of knowledge and intercultural harmony, with wide applicability in other contexts and educational levels.', 'Design and develop an educational model for the collective creation of materials for science education in intercultural contexts, based on collaborative work practices mediated by technology resources.\nDevelop a theoretical and methodological framework for setting and analysis of the technological mediated collaborative creation resources in an intercultural educational context for science education. It will hold a collective experience creating materials based model of collaborative work mediated by information technology and communication (ICT) in a secondary school in an intercultural context. The results of the experiment will analyze and evaluate their applicability to other communities and contexts of Mexico.\nThe first part of this project will focus on project work, educational projects are planned activities that involve coordinated sequences of actions and reflections and interrelated to achieve the expected learning. Activities include interdisciplinary teaching, long term, student-centered, rather than short, isolated lessons, which offer opportunities to introduce into the classroom a wide range of learning opportunities. Project work permit to establish relationships between the community and school. They can be motivating because they start from the knowledge of students and allow them to be directly involved in the decisions made regarding the project and the results obtained. Promote collaborative learning, develop communication and metacognitive activities (ie, the ability to reflect on what learning and research). The project-based teaching allows arrange an research-based pedagogy and allows you to go beyond rote learning. In this sense, what is sought with this methodology is that young people are allowed assessment of its knowledge, the recovery of community knowledge and promotes metacognition, regulation and autonomy to put in the hands of the student both the generation questions such as the possibility of searching for answers. This methodology integrates the contents to give meaning to learning, sharing of knowledge among students is encouraged, and requests that the student is responsible for knowledge about their communication, development and distribution; combined with decision making regarding the achievement of tangible and intangible products.\nWe will also use the methodology: the community-based education. With this methodology, students interact with members of their community and to generate more interaction between the community and the school will be allowed. We believe it is essential to recognize the community as a place of knowledge and its members, both children and adults, as subjects of knowledge. In this sense, the use of ICT allowed to use the information to identify and generate knowledge from the information gathered through the formulation of research questions. Therefore, this methodology is left to think about the community as void of knowledge to think of it as the space where knowledge is generated and / or space in which mutual learning takes place.\nRecovery and systematization of local knowledge is a necessary condition for intercultural dialogue that will enrich the world''s understanding of each individual, to establish an intercultural dialogue is needed to recognize and value the same for then build the interface between cultures or individuals who interact. In this phase, it is intended that, once the students have created a product in ICT from their research, using them as material that allows them to develop skills and build knowledge, while strengthening their cultural identity and assess the knowledge that emerges from the community.\nThe project presented seeks to emphasize interdisciplinary work to generate activities that integrate knowledge from various disciplines. Much has been said about the artificial separation of knowledge that makes the school and how this is an impediment to the appropriation of knowledge, so the integration of different subjects with a series of activities intended to generate relation to the activities of the community. Thus, in this project it is intended that the activities are related to the different subjects of the plans and programs to achieve the development of learning in an interrelated manner.\nWe consider that the methodologies described above meet the objectives proposed by OCSDNet because they seek to have an understanding of the social contexts and promote open science. In this regard, we believe that through science education and social appropriation of knowledge of the communities in which the project will operate, helping strengthen local capacity for research, offering new tools and approaches to development.', 'This proposal will contribute to the development of models for the establishment of intercultural education and the integration of various technological resources in educational practice, based on the analysis of its application in a specific context.

Note that  monitoring will be used to maintain a constant feedback with the community, who are the agents for the construction of knowledge. In this sense, during the second year this platform will be implemented for the use of teachers and students with the goal of implementing on the one hand the methodological tools developed in the first year and, and on the other, add the products made by students and teachers. \nTherefore, we believe that creating the "Virtual Logbook" will enable us to maintain constant monitoring and ongoing evaluation of the development of the project, thanks to  the fact that the results are obtained in "real time"  with the participants finding themselves situated in different regions of the country. Therefore, we believe that this technological tool is ideal to maintain interaction, updating and efficacy between project stakeholders. It will also allow to check the progress of the project and its results. Also allow you to collect evidence of what has been achieved at all times, to determine how it works and how it has been the intervention for the generation, distribution and appropriation of knowledge. \nFinally, we consider the constant monitoring and evaluation of the project from a technological platform such  as the "Virtual Logbook" will allowfor the communication of practices and the development and theorization of external agents such as other researchers, othere communities to strengthen investigations and the formulation of policies that are related with the strengthening of the social appropriation of knowledge.', '79,920', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/Carta_SSCyDC.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudgetTemplate53.xlsx', 133, 251, 'complete', 'yes', 1411161608, 'complete', '', '', 35, NULL, 'yes');

Due to the dominant nature of university-to-industry model, most research institutions in Africa are preoccupied with closed and proprietary methods for generating and communicating research similar to the closed systems predominantly found in industrialized societies (Ncube, Abrahams & Akinsanmi, 2013). That partly explains why the diffusion and uptake of scientific research out of African university and research institutions remains low since formal industries constitute only a small part of a typical African economy.  \nFew research institutions are fostering university-to-informal sector collaborative knowledge transfers. This kind of vertical integration is particularly important in Africa where the informal sector has grown exponentially in the last few decades today accounting for upwards of sixty percent (60%) of socioeconomic activities in most African countries (Charmes, 2012). Moreover, informal sector innovations in Africa are predominantly open and collaborative in nature (Daniels, 2010; Kawooya, 2013; de Beer, Kun & Sacha, 2013). Therefore, collaborations between formal research institutions and informal sectors provides an important frontier for promoting open and collaborative science (OCS) currently lacking in Africa’s formal research institutions and universities. \n\nThe goal of this study is for formal institution researchers to learn and adopt the openness virtues and ethos of informal sector actors with whom they collaborate. But what are the incentives for formal sector researchers to adopt the same ethos and virtues of collaboration and open sharing and transfer of research and innovations? Will the researchers in the formal institutions co-opt informal sector actors into formal systems of knowledge governance and control exemplified by the proprietary intellectual property (IP) systems? Based on the work we recently completed and briefly described below, we believe that formal research institutions can adopt more open and collaborative research and open exchange or transfer of research output. \n\nBetween 2009 and 2014, IDRC’s funded Open African Innovation Research and Training (Open A.I.R.) Project supported a number of ground-breaking research case studies on innovation and IP in Africa. One of the case studies looked at the role of IP in the interactions between formal research institutions and informal artisans in Uganda (Kawooya 2013). The Ugandan case study looked at how researchers at the Centre for Research in Transportation Technologies (CRTT) of the College of Engineering, Design, Art and Technology (CEDAT) at Makerere University in Uganda worked with informal artisans in the production of the Kiira EV, a prototype electric car designed by CRTT researchers. We were interested in understanding how important IP was to CRTT researchers in their interaction with the informal artisans involved in the production of the prototype car. Findings from the Ugandan case study revealed that informal artisans involved in fabricating and producing parts of the Kiira EV prototype car not interested in IP let alone aware of formal IP systems and tools. Not only where they not aware, they were willing to openly share their knowhow with CRTT researchers. On the other hand, CRTT researchers prevented the artisans from using or sharing car designs given to them for purposes of producing specific parts of the prototype car. CRTT researchers achieved this by requiring the artisans to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).  Details of this study can be found at: http://www.openair.org.za/images/9781775821809.pdf. The proposed study builds on the Ugandan case to understand how researchers in formal institutions like CRTT collaborating with informal sectors can be persuaded to adopt open approaches to research and research knowledge sharing without necessarily defaulting to closed proprietary models for knowledge governance.  \n\nResearch Questions:\nBased on the findings of this case study, the proposed project will examine the following research questions:\n1) How can the formal-to-informal sector vertical integrations encourage African researchers to embrace open collaborative research and knowledge generation evident in Africa’s informal sector industries? \n2) If pursued and expanded, can the formal-informal vertical integrations facilitate the diffusion of research from universities to informal industries thus expanding socioeconomic opportunities for the poor in the informal sector? \n3) Given the strong institutional framework in which formal researchers exist, will they not dominate informal actors into abandoning the openness virtues they espouse in the process of vertical integration? \n4) What kind of public policy interventions are necessary to foster the formal-informal vertical integration and OCS in these relationships?', 'Since the completion of the Ugandan case study under the Open A.I.R Project, Kiira EV Project researchers redesigned the prototype in preparation for large scale industrial production of different models of the car by the year 2018.  This is a unique moment in the life of the car and relationship between CRTT and the informal artisans involved in the production of the original prototype. Will CRTT continue to involve them in the next stages as they transition from research and design stages to production? If CRTT is planning to integrate them, how will the informal artisan fit into the formal production processes and infrastructure without losing the informal virtues of knowledge sharing and appropriation? \nThrough a series of separate focus group discussions (FGDs) amongst CRTT researchers and informal artisans, we will study the transition process looking for evidence of vertical integrate of informal artisans into the production processes and activities. We will follow up with mixed FGDs involving both CRTT researchers and artisans to focusing on knowledge sharing in the informal sectors. Both separate and mixed FGDs will be geared toward addressing issues of integration with informal artisans and well as openness of CRTT researchers. \nThe FGDs will be followed by individual qualitative interviews with and observation of CRTT researchers and informal artisans for evidence of integration of informal artisans into the production processes. We will look for evidence of adaption of openness by CRTT researchers and the role informal artisans played in facilitating the change of behaviors. If no changes are observable or mentioned by CRTT researchers in the interviews, we will attempt to understand why and how they can be persuaded to adopt open models for research and knowledge sharing espoused by artisans with whom they interact.  Interviews and observations with artisans and researchers will specifically focus on what each group learns from the other. For artisans, this should entail accessing and utilizing appropriate CRTT research and innovations. For CRTT researchers, the learning entails adopting or willingness to adopt openness virtues and ethos of the artisans.  Finally, for CRTT researchers, we will specifically seek to know the kind of incentives and institutional or government policies necessary to adopt open sharing of their research with informal artisans and beyond.', 'Relevance of the proposed study to OCSDNET\nThe next phase of the Open A.I.R project focuses on ‘business models’ and that are complementary to the proposed study. The proposed study will help the OCSDNet researchers better understand openness models involving formal-informal sector interactions beyond orthodox "commercialization" strategies for mobilizing knowledge between and across the formal sectors. The informal sector is far more relevant to the majority of the world''s population living in poverty.  \n\nRelevance to Development Outcomes\nGiven the resilience of the informal sector in Africa and the role it plays in expanding employment opportunities, there is a need for concerted efforts to facilitate scaling-up innovation and production activities of informal enterprises. Integrating of the informal sector with formal institutions in mutually beneficial knowledge sharing activities is one of facilitating the scaling up and sustaining informal sector enterprises. Ultimately, it’s an important way of expanding employment opportunities for the many young Africans who cannot find work in the small formal sector. Understanding how the vertical integration between formal and informal sectors can happen without undermining the openness virtues espoused by the informal sector actors is at the centre of the proposed study. Not only will it ensure that formal research output from academic institutions finds application in informal enterprises thereby expanding economic activities. It will do so in a manner that promotes more open and inclusive development directly benefiting the poor in the informal sector.', 'The primary means for monitoring and evaluation is observation or affirmation of change of behavior or attitude by CRTT researchers towards OCS or openness to open sharing of research they would otherwise protect using traditional tools. We will specifically observe or seek evidence of or willingness to transfer and exchange of that knowledge with informal artisans under open terms unlike the NDAs they previously required them to sign. The behavior and/or attitude changes will most likely be noted after the series of FGDs.  OCSDNet’s internal reporting and IDRC’s evaluation tools and personnel will be used as external evaluators for this case study.', '49,500.00', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/Endorsement_Letter_-_Kawooya_De_Beer1.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/Kawooya-De_Beer_OCSDNet_Budget1.xlsx', 148, NULL, 'complete', 'yes', 1410226700, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, 'yes'),

This part will be based on data collection on the Internet; and interviews with those who have a broad and informed view of the field of Open Science in Brazil and can help to select significant initiatives, such as advocates, practitioners and privileged observers. The idea is to present a qualitative and updated overview which can subsidize the project&acute;s action component. For this selection, the following aspects will be considered: - innovativeness in terms of open knowledge production&acute;s methods and instruments; - diversity in terms of focii and approaches and, as far as possible, the regional diversity within the Brazilian context; - time of existence sufficient to analyse their problems, results and learning.</p><p>b) We will monitor the action component, producing information and analysis based on observation, registration, and interviews with working groups&acute;participants. The purpose of this part is to evaluate the adherence to the procedures of open, collaborative science, its requirements and obstacles. This survey will consider: - types of participants, their motivations, background, and institutional affiliation; - tools and channels of data and knowledge sharing; - informational governance structures and processes; - openness for external collaborations; - conditions for access to data and materials, and for participation in the research results. The collected material in the survey will be registered on wiki, leaving room for contributions.</p>', '<p>All of the potential communities identified for establishment of working group activities engage in research that generates knowledge relevant to development. The choice of tropical forests and drug discovery or semi-arid geographies and environmental monitoring is strategic as these two groups have potential to interact on common themes, with the OCS methodologies of open data sharing and open notebook science potentially cutting across many research efforts. The outcomes of the action component will have developmental relevance at several levels.</p><p>Firstly, individual researchers participating in working groups during the project will continue creating knowledge through their own research with a potentially greater social incentive and ability to use OCS approaches and particularly to disseminate results openly. We expect, for example, more development-related scientific data to be released, greater involvement of citizen scientists and open participation in projects led by working group members and greater experimentation with alternative methods of collaboration and communication, although demonstrating a downstream impact on development is not within the scope of this project. Some individuals will also be trained in community leadership and digital engagement which will not only build capacity for leadership is OCS research and practice but also be applicable beyond this in collaborations and policy engagement around their particular research.</p><p>The findings from the action component will be shared via blogs, mailing lists and social media channels with the open science community but also the broader open knowledge community, with includes open development practitioners and civil society groups. Working groups may be useful testbeds for other social innovation projects and learning from this experiment will complement other groups who are promoting the sharing of sustainable social practices for development [1]. Outcomes of research components shall contribute to:</p><p>- advance the state of the art of the knowledge about the OSC for development, in its theoretical, methodological, and empirical dimensions;</p><p>- enlarge and promote the debate on OCS both in the research communities and in the political and institutional agendas;</p><p>- promote the dissemination of new practices in OCS in different areas, especially those pursuing social social development targets;</p><p>- training of researchers at the scientific initiation, masters, doctorate and post-doctorate levels, encouraging and guiding the conduct of research on this topic, motivating new agendas, issues and research procedures in the field of OCS for development;</p><p>- stimulating international articulation and cooperation in OSC, mainly on a South-South level, addressing the Global South research interests;</p><p>- formulate and disseminate new issues and challenges for institutional and governmental strategies and policies able to address and support OSC initiatives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>', '<p>ACTION COMPONENT The community coordinator will be in contact with working groups throughout the project, and monitoring their progress will take place via a recorded monthly online conference call open to members of each community and with participation of Jenny and Ale. This call will be recorded and the main updates, outcomes and learning points summarised and openly shared.</p><p>The key monitoring criteria will be member engagement in the working group, activities being planned or underway, whether development is being incorporated into the discourse of the community, the ability of the working group to document its activities, usefulness of tools and channels created, and any shift in adoption of open practices within the working group, around it, or that was recognized as relevant.</p><p>As the group progresses and becomes more established, with positive outcomes in the above criteria, we will start monitoring actual incorporation of development goal as targets of open practices. It is possible that this happens earlier in the process, and if that happens we will have to discuss whether to focus on that so there&#39;s no mismatch between early movers and the overall community. The community of the working groups, plus the Open Knowledge Brasil community, is also expected to monitor the progress of the project, in particular reports will be presented by the community coordinator to the Open Knowledge Brazil community during their biweekly meetings at least once a month, regarding expenses of the project which would already have been publicly recorded. In case of any mobilization activity taking place outside of Brazil, relevant academic and openness communities are expected to be informed and, in case they choose to, welcome to help plan, monitor and criticize the process.</p><p>RESEARCH COMPONENT Three sets of monitoring and evaluation procedures will be adopted in the project&acute;s research component:</p><p>- Online availability of data collection, in order to receive not only contributions, but also corrections and critical perspectives.</p><p>- Organization of 4 Research Seminars (1 per Semester), aiming at hearing invited specialists, activists and practitioners in OCS, as well as to present, debate, and disseminate partial and final results (additional financial resources will be used for these activities).</p><p>- Elaboration of an interpretative synthesis, systematizing the results and proposed actions and strategies, to be submitted to critical views and expertise, in the last semester of the project&acute;s duration.</p>', '80,000', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/LettertoIDRC-OpenScienceSeptember820142.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/ocsdnet_-_okbr_budget1.xlsx', 160, 252, 'complete', 'yes', 1411227105, 'complete', 'I like the combination of action and research here.

(94, 'Mr Koffi Dodji Honou, the principal researcher, graduated from the African independant School of Technology and applied Science (ELATSA, Lome, Togo). After gaining experience in the private sector, Mr. Honou co-founded the FabLab WOELAB (do it yourself in mina)  in August 2012 in Lomé (Togo).\nWOELAB is the first collaborative space of technological democracy, innovation and creativity in Africa. Developed in the framework of HubCité project (Smart cities), WOELAB’s main objectives is to democratize access to ICTs and bring it to the local level in order to unleash the local community’s creativity and respond to their daily needs.\nIts functioning system is based on the double condition of open access, collaboration and transparency. In short, WOELAB is a space of technological democracy that seeks to disseminate LowHighTech knowledge in the community according to their developmental needs. WOELAB promotes voluntary and mutual assistance, the search for a comprehensive and common intelligence as well as free technological support to community members.\nAs WOELAB’s manager, Mr. Honou developed an: \n- Expertise in FABLAB’s implementation, development and animation; \n- Expertise in setting up start-ups and managing ICT projects in order to improve the community’s well-being; \n- Expertise in the management of Fablab’s human, financial and material resources.\nFinally, he specialized in exploiting and disseminating LowHighTech by organizing workshops and events related to ICTs. Currently, Mr. Honou works with the NGO Ker Thiossane in Dakar (Senegal) in order to set a FabLab called DEFKO AK NIEP (let’s do it together in wolof). His knowledge of FabLab’s functioning systems will help define the real impact of open and collaborative science initiatives on local development.\n\nMs. Marie Anitha Jaotody holds a Master degree in Public and International Affairs from York University (Toronto, ON, Canada). Her experiences allowed her to develop skills in research and methodology design as well as research projects management. During her experiences in the public and private sectors at the provincial, national and international level, Ms. Jaotody contributed to the development of research methodology, to the definition of theoretical frameworks and to the identification of appropriate data sources in education in Africa.\nIn this context, she perfected her skills in the various stages of research management namely: data collection, sorting, classification, analysis, comparison, synthesis, and finally the dissemination of research results. Her research experiences in Senegal, Ivory Coast and Ethiopia have allowed her to have field experience in research in Africa.\nThe complementary of Mr Honou’s practical skills and Ms Jaotody’s theoretical skill is a major asset in carrying out the case study. Indeed, Ms. Jaotody skills in research design and management complete Mr .Honou’s depth knowledge of open and collaborative spaces in ICTs sector in Africa.', 'Placing ICTs at the heart of local development process: The real impact of WOELAB (a technological open and collaborative space) on local development and population well-being.', 'Togo', 'Context, rationale and significance of the proposed study\nToday, much is said about Africa being the future hub of global economic growth if we take into account the growth rate in a context of global recession, its demographic potential and its natural resources. Indeed, the African continent has an average growth of 5% for the last 10 years. Some countries achieve growth of over 7% per year . \nIn terms of human resources, two thirds of Africa''s population is under 25 years . This represents a large workforce and a significant source of wealth if countries are able to take advantage of the demographic dividend. Finally, the continent has 8% of global oil reserves , 60% of non-cultivated land and 37% of arable land  . In short, Africa is definitely the land of opportunities.\n\nGiven the global economic environment, the demographic context and the natural resources available in Africa, it is essential to look into the various issues that the continent will face if \nAfrican decision makers want to tackle the socio-economic development of African people.\nThe main obstacle in achieving the development goals remains inequalities and very poor redistribution of material and immaterial resources available. Indeed, the issue of inequality remains very problematic because they are sources of political, social and economic instability. Inequalities are found in areas such as education, training, employment, access to cultivable land, etc.\n\nIn this case study, we want to look at an issue related to inequality in accessing ICTs and knowledge. Indeed, we believe that democratization of access to ICTs plays an important role in the development process. However, as mentioned earlier access to ICTs in Africa is also subjected to inequality.  Indeed, group of population such as rural populations, low-income households and girls/women have less access to ICT and therefore, they also have less access to information, knowledge and dignity.\n\nResearch question\nThis leads us to the following questions: Does open and Collaborative practices democratize and open access to ICTs (independent variable)? Does it initiate local communities’ development in Togo (dependent variable)? At last, what are the real impact of open and collaborative science practices on the local development and African societies?\n\n\nProblem and development challenge being tackled\nThe main development challenge being tackled in the proposed case study is inequality in accessing ICTs and knowledge. Indeed, as mentioned in OCSDN Background Paper , development has always been discussed from an economic point of view. However, with the development of ICT and given its importance in economic, social and political activities, it is essential to systematically integrate them in the development process of African countries. Although ICTs are gradually introduced in the lives of African people, a significant part of the population remains excluded, they do not enjoy the opportunities offered by ICTs and they can’t take responsibilities for their own development.\nBy adopting open and collaborative practices, WOELAB tackles the issue of inequality by bringing ICT, science and knowledge to local communities and aims to attract local communities so they can unleash their creativity according to their needs and improve their lives. However, a serious academic study on WOELAB’s impact on local development has never been conducted.', 'Research design and the methodologies for the project \nThe proposed research project is an exploratory case study of the “Small digital republic", WOELAB. WOELAB is a place where innovation is developed daily and new approaches of productive open and collaborative practices in the African context are tested according the terms of reference of #LowHighTech . \nTo carry out this case study and understand the impact of WOELAB’s open and collaborative practices on development, we intend to perform the following tasks:\nI. Definition of theoretical framework\na.  Institutional Analysis and development framework & Common pool theory: How do WOELAB members come together, create communities and organizations, make decisions and rules in order to sustain a resource (knowledge and information) and achieve a desired outcome (local development and democratization of science)?\n\nb. Theory of change: Identification of Actors, issues, enabling mechanisms, outcomes related to development goals locally and beyond.\n\nII. Data collection and gathering\na. Conduct a literature review on FabLabs and open collaborative practices in order to assess knowledge and clearly identify the issues and challenges related to the topic being studied. The literature review will be done from academic articles of databases such as: Directory of open access journal (DOAJ), Bielefeld Academic Search Engine (BASE), Google Scholar, Ingentaconnect, JSTOR, Microsoft Academic, OAIster, Opensigle, OCLC WorldCat ;\nb. Design three types of questionnaires and interviews for three different groups in order to assess their knowledge of WOELAB’s activities and functioning: Djidjolé neighborhood (local community), WOELAB members, decision makers and WOELAB’s partners.\n\nIII. Sorting questionnaire data\na. Classify, categorize, thematize and schematize data obtained from questionnaire\nb. Develop criteria and indicators to measure positive and negative impacts of open and collaborative science\n\nIV. Data verification and comparison\na. Checking  data quality, consistency and relevance according to the research subject\n\nV. Research results and data  Analysis \na. Identification of positive and negative impact of WOELAB’s open and collaborative practices on local communities. \nb. Submit clear, brief and nuanced answer to the research question.\n\nVI. Data synthesis and dissemination \na. Presentation of research results (written and verbal).\n\nVII. Research project monitoring and assessment\na. Assessment of various phases of research and monitoring of data obtained.\nb. Identify the methodology and the theoretical frameworks strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\nHow are they supportive of the ideals of OCSDN?\nFalling within the logic and values promoted by the Budapest Open Access Initiative, OCSDN ideals are based on open development initiatives and practices, equal access to information and knowledge and promotion of a technology-based development. WOELAB’s purpose and functioning are based on those same principles and the case study that we intend to carry out will enrich OCSDN reflexion by producing empirical data on open and collaborative practices in an African context. With this case study, OCSDN will have a better insight of how these values and principle are concretized on the field.', 'Expected outcomes and usefulness for the proposed study\nFollowing this study, we hope to:\n- Determine criteria and indicators to measure positive and negative impacts of WOELAB’s Open and collaborative practices on local development and local population behavior towards WOELABs.\n- Understand new models of development projects that are not related to state institutions and improve theoretical framework on their origin and functioning methods.\n- Provide additional information and knowledge on the operationalization and practices of open and collaborative principles and values in African contexts.\n- Generate information and knowledge on technology-based development process\n- Understand limits and opportunities of adopting Open and Collaborative practices in Africa.\n- Conduct further case studies on other African structures like WOELAB for comparison purposes and more meaningful conclusions.\n\nPolicy relevance\nThe findings of the study will allow us to formulate recommendations for decision makers and eventually implement mechanisms and resources to support and reproduce initiatives that have positive impacts on local development. The case study conducted may also contribute to the development of relevant public policies related to the democratization of ICTs in Togo.', 'To improve our methodologies and research results for future case studies, we will proceed to the following monitoring and evaluation plan. An assessment form with a rating of 1 (dissatisfied) to 10 (very satisfied) will be designed to quantify the research project quality and relevance.

Apart from substantial theoretical development, pioneering a series of theoretical, methodological and empirical advances in the area of social epidemiology, research methodology and epistemology of science, Jaime conducted several research projects engaging local communities. Jaime further pioneered innovations in health surveillance, creating instruments for participatory monitoring. As the director of the PhD program on Health, Environment and Society of Universidad Andina Simon Bolivar, Jaime has been a key collaborator of the Regional Observatory on Health and environment (http://saludyambiente.uasb.edu.ec), which has assumed a critical role in the dissemination of information on health inequities, social and environmental injustices, empowering local communities and contributing to the dissemination of silenced knowledge.\nMarcelo Firpo de Souza Porto coordinates the map of conflicts involving environmental injustices and health (http://www.conflitoambiental.icict.fiocruz.br), is an active member of the Brazilian Network for Environmental Justice (RBJA) and has carried out research involving participatory evaluations and monitoring of policies in urban slums in Rio de Janeiro (PAC). He will further contribute to this project with his experience on environmental health, environmental justice, and “post-normal science”.', 'Socio-environmental conflicts and the social determination of the health-disease process in Medellin, Bogotá, Rio de Janeiro and Quito', 'Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador', 'As urbanization accelerates and the unhealthy relationship between industrialized conurbations and agro-industrial rural areas exacerbates, space for the healthy and sustainable reproduction of people and ecosystems is increasingly lost and socio-environmental conflicts around water, food, air and soil increase. \nThis project seeks to map and analyze cases of socio-environmental conflict that shape the social determination of the health-disease process in major Latin American cities and develop a framework for the understanding of socio-environmental conflicts and processes of social determination in health in urban settings in Latin America. In this regard, the project aims to bring together a consortium of researchers from three Latin American countries, grass-root organizations active in environmental and social justice issues as well as the communities supported by the organizations to identify and analyze socio-environmental conflicts and document implications with regard to the degradation of health and environment. With the participatory construction of an openly accessible and interactive map of socio-environmental conflicts the project seeks to contribute to the development of sustainable and openly accessible tools (map, framework and analyses) for systematic exchange of experiences and learning and further seeks to expand the opportunities for a broad range of actors to participate in the knowledge production process on socio-environmental conflicts and the determination of the health-disease process in urban settings in Latin America. \nThe project seeks to open up the entire research process from defining the nature of the socio-environmental conflict, data generation, data analysis and dissemination. By focusing on conflicts, the project further introduces openness in what regards the consideration of actors and strategies towards tackling health inequities and socio-environmental degradation in urban settings, emphazing and capitalizing on the role and potential of community-based and organized collective action of and in collaboration with affected communities. \nIn this regard, the project seeks to overcome the mere identification of “vulnerable populations” and the recognition of linear associations between socio-environmental risk factors and health outcomes and recognizes the need to analyze the social determination of the health-disease processes as part of broader social processes that shape and reproduce the vulnerabilization of historically subordinated population groups and the immanent social structure. In the particular case of socio-environmental conflicts and processes of social determination in health in urban settings in Latin America this translates into the need to understand socio-environmental conflicts in urban settings as an expression of the unsustainability of the dominant development model that shapes Latin American economies and cities, the insertion of the latter in the global processes of capitalist production and accumulation and further expresses the systematic degradation of health and environment in Latin American cities.', 'accumulated knowledge from scientific, community and activist practice and develop tools that serve to better understand the social determination of the health-disease process in urban settings shaped by socio-environmental conflicts, document implications with regard to the degradation of health and environment and foster processes of social transformation. \nIn the first phase of the project, socio-environmental conflicts and actors involved in these conflicts are mapped on the basis of a comprehensive literature review, including “grey literature”. In a second phase, a preliminary identification of socio-environmental conflicts is proposed and is submitted for validation to non-peers, namely grass-root organizations active in environmental and social justice issues as well as the communities supported by the organizations. Apart from validating the selection/identification of conflicts and preliminary analyses produced by the researchers in focus group discussions, alternative analyses are foreseen to be developed as an extended community of practice (researchers, activists and community members) and to be consolidated in an interactive and openly accessible map of socio-environmental conflicts in workshops to be held in the respective cities. Finally, the project seeks to translate the findings of this collaborative research and mutual learning process into the policy arena and therefore seeks to develop policy briefs and “action briefs”, the latter seeking to make experiences of grass-root organizations and communities visible to a broader public and inform practices on the basis of the accumulated knowledge.', 'The project seeks to address the social determination of the health-disease process in urban settings shaped by socio-environmental conflicts.

With the participatory construction of an openly accessible and interactive map of socio-environmental conflicts the project seeks to contribute to the development of sustainable and openly accessible tools (map, framework and analyses) for systematic exchange of experiences and learning that will foster strategies towards the radical transformation of the processes of social determination that shape health and environment in the Latin American cities analyzed in the context of this project.', 'During implementation, the project is subject to continuous monitoring and evaluation which will be based on a process involving all partners and stakeholders.

These practices are frequently informal and in the developing world tend to operate outside of institutional policies on intellectual property, personal data and other legal issues. An extremely dynamic global policy environment produces extrinsic shocks on developing country research environments. Changes to institutional policies and national legislation prompted by the ataxic global policy environment pose a serious, if under-appreciated risk for emerging practice of open science for development. The realization of the promise of open research requires policies and legal regimes that protect the development of sustainable open research and dissemination. Researchers, whether in the physical or social sciences, especially in developing world contexts are  frequently unaware of the potential of institutional policies and law, especially intellectual property regimes to curtail their ability to develop collaborative practices into sustainable mechanisms that enable distributed research practices. Research is however largely underwritten by public authorities of various sorts and consequently subject to policy forces which may be largely invisible or opaque to many researchers. While open research compromises  data, sample materials and journal articles as both outputs and inputs of research, national and institutional policies tend to characterize data and journal articles as outputs, often measured in fairly crude ways.\nOne particularly persistent set of challenges are the decades long efforts of global multinational corporations to establish ownership of productive knowledge including publicly funded scientific knowledge. This includes the export of Bayh-Dole type legislation as a mechanism for technology transfer, t  and the the response of multi-national publishers to the Open Access movement. Developing country policymakers seeking comparative advantage for national economies all too easily adopt the logic of indiscriminate commoditisation of scientific knowledge. \n\n\nThe experience of South Africa is instructive in this respect, open research practices were beginning to prove their worth when they were disrupted by the introduction of legislation requiring universities to patent all new knowledge. In the United States the costs of Bayh-Dole to the sector as a whole outweigh the windfall profits of a few institutions. Nevertheless the Bayh-Dole regime is being exported to developing countries. Although some developing countries, for example India, have thuse far resisted, some including South Africa have adopted Bayh-Dole type regimes. The push to transplant Bayh-Dole to South Africa was rationalized by reference to a theory of development in which  increased intellectual property gives national trade advantage rather than in response to the research practises of South African researchers. Although public advocacy managed to secure some space for the continuation of open and collaborative practices the experience constitutes a cautionary example for other developing countries. The export of Bayh-Dole type regimes to developing countries is only one example of a policy development extrinsic to a research environment that affects the environment. There is thus a considerable although largely under-appreciated risk that the nascent practices of open and collaborative science in developing countries, especially in Africa will be foreclosed by policy developments that originate outside of the research environment.\n\nLaw and policy\n\nLegal issues are too frequently viewed in isolation from broader policy structures. However legal rules and tools are embedded in and activated by institutions and other policy structures. While legal rules  such as national legislation on genetic resources are binding, and frequently require expert interpretation legal tools such as Creative Commons licenses are optional and may be deployed by non-lawyers. This is significant for open and collaborative science in development since the deployment of tools depends on the freedom given to institutions, researchers and projects by the rules. Legal issues that immediately impact on scientific including social scientific research are not confined to intellectual property but include issues around personal data and privacy. Emerging practices of citizen science which are especially attractive in developing countries because, inter alia, they reduce costs of research for under-resourced researchers encounter issues both of ownership of contributions and practices to safeguard the personal data of participants. Many African countries have recently introduced or about to introduce personal data regimes which will affect research practices. Legal tools such as open licenses are insufficient to enable open practices, researchers need both the capacity to use the tools but also freedom to do so, thus the need for policies at various levels including national level that mandate use of the legal tools.', 'Design\nThe case study will traverse the salient legal and policy issues that affect the emergence of Open Science in South Africa as an exemplar; ownership of and access to publicly funded knowledge; intellectual property law, personal data and protection laws, indigenous knowledge and biodiversity and university technology transfer practises. Law and policy, considered as an integrated structure will be assessed at international, continental, regional, national and institutional levels. The study will consider both past experiences and future trends, and place the South African experience within the context of global developments. For example, an assessment of the South African Intellectual Property from Publicly Financed Research Act 2009 will note the impact that the passing of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980 has had in the United States, including recent developments, the policy drivers for the passing of the Act, resistance by Open Access advocates, the space created by resistance and the use of the space by South African universities. \n\nThe study will consider self proclaimed open projects even where these are not legally open such as the Human Sciences Research Council Press “open” access policy. Although there is grey literature such as project reports on many of the issues these have not been fitted into an analysis that considers how the legal and policy constraints at each level interlock with those at every level. The case study will highlight global policy constraints that are often ignored such as those imposed by the Convention on Biodiversity and the Nagoya Protocol. \n\nWhile personal data has been protected for decades in the European Union most African countries have only recently begun or are still in the process of creating legal regimes to protect personal data,and the effects on scientific research are not yet. South Africa passed legislation only a few years before most other African countries and the effect on scientific research, although still emerging is predictive for other African countries.\n\nThe study will produce a model of how each policy level interacts with the other policy levels, and how legal instruments provide hard limits to agency of actors including those at other levels. One result will be a much clearer picture of the space available to individual researchers, research projects and networks and publicly funded research institutions in developing countries especially those in Africa. While legal rules such as university technology transfer policies constrain the agency of researchers and research collectives to engage in collaborative research legal tools such as Creative Commons Zero enable collaborative research and the case study will consider not only current use of such tools but the potential to use them.\nMethodology\nThe case study will proceed by constructing a model of interlocking policy and legal levels; international, continental, regional, national and institutional. At each level the constraints and opportunities for Open and Collaborative Science for development will be examined, as well as significance of these for related levels. \nAnalysis of the primary legal instruments; treaties, international agreements, legislation and exemplar contracts and licenses  will be placed in policy context by drawing on the grey literature including reports generated by previous IDRC funded projects, including those in which the co-principle researchers have participated for example the report on  ''Opening Access to Knowledge in Southern African Universities'' (SARUA 2008) co-authored by Andrew Rens.\nEmerging trends and the relatively short history of Open Science will be identified through qualitative interviews with key leader in both the global North and the global South. \nThe report itself will be produced in an open manner with a Request For Comments being circulated both within the Open and Collaborative Science in Development Network and to interviewees.\nThe research team will seek to engage with other research teams in the Open and Collaborative Science in Development Network to ascertain points of connection, synergies and means of mutual collaboration.', 'Relevance\nLaw and knowledge policies are an issue that cuts across all four themes. Open licenses, the primary legal means of enabling Open Science were developed by ideologically motivated communities such as the Free Software movement which believe certain types of knowledge goods should be free, that is available for sharing and re-use by all. Legal tools such as open licenses are useful only when there is legal freedom to use them, thus policies which mandate the use of open licenses, protocols and waivers, together with the tools themselves constitute critical infrastructure.  The agency afforded to   communities of practice by the multiple interlocking policy levels and the extent to which that agency has been exercised through use of legal tools such as open licenses is a crucial aspect of understanding Communities of Practice in the global South. The potential impacts of Open and Collaborative Science are shaped by the legal and policy structure already in place as well as developments in a dynamic global policy environment. If this case study had to be characterized as primarily belonging under a particular theme it would be as an essential factor in determining the potential for open and collaborative science.\n\nDevelopment Outcomes:\nOutcomes\n\nA significantly increased understanding of the policy space for Open and Collaborative Science in Development imposed by legal and policy regimes from international to institutional levels.\nA model of how law and policy operate to structure Open and Collaborative Science at international, national, continental, regional, national and institutional levels that is immediately useful to policy makers and advocacy groups at the different levels.\nAn analysis of the global regime and global developments that is immediately useful to policy makers and advocacy groups in the global South,  which coupled with the continental analysis is especially useful to policy makers in Africa. \nAn indication of the outcome of legal and policy changes currently being considered in many developing countries, such as personal data protection regimes, Bayh-Dole type legislation and open access mandates for public research immediately useful to policy makers in developing countries.', 'The case study is intended to be immediately useful to OCSDNet participants, a dissemination and monitoring plan is therefore best devised when more information on these participants is available.', '$80,000.', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/Rens_letter.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/LawRulesTools_budget.xlsx', 196, 255, 'complete', 'yes', 1411252039, 'complete', 'I think this proposal is addressing some very important issues for OCS - the central questions around how universities and other institutions are going to be able to adapt to major changes in the way research is performed.

His doctoral work investigated metrics of network structure and approaches to model the adoption of behaviors in artificial societies. Later he worked on applying network theory to sampling of hard-to-reach populations, which involved developing social games to extract information. His ongoing work is a research-action project applying collaboration technologies to enable knowledge sharing and continuous inpatient care between health care professionals in a hospital and its surrounding basic care units, whose attention network covers hundreds of thousands of people in one of the poorest regions of São Paulo city. He has also worked with development issues as a researcher and implementer of digital inclusion programs and activities with school teachers, poor neighborhoods and traditional communities in different regions of Brazil.

She is recognized for her contributions to policy issues and is currently supervising students on openness in science.', 'Understanding and strengthening the development impact of community based knowledge production spaces by combining ethnographic and data analysis of their evolution as a collaboration network', 'Brazil', 'Through the last decade, in parallel with the introduction of digital technologies, community based knowledge production spaces sprung in different parts of Brazil, some supported by government programs - telecenters, culture spots - while others self-financed by its members - hackerspaces, culture houses. It is generally accepted, based on previous literature, reports and testmonials, that these prototipical citizen science environments play an important role in the improvement of life in connected communities, as a venue for knowledge intensive emancipatory practices both economical and political. Furthermore, some of these spaces share characteristics which make them a rich target for research: a strong digital record on mailing lists, wikis and blogs; participants with diverse backgrounds, from professionals to students to career academics; known impact stories involving knowledge transfer, innovation and development by and of communities. We propose to collect and structure the digital tracks of these initiatives, while performing ethnographical research to connect that information to broader individual and social contexts. The outputs of this stage would then be fed to statistical analysis which will inform critical discourse on the construction of these spaces, on their role in development of connected communities, and on their ambiguous relationships with academic institutions and governments. In addition, throughout the research cycle and together with these communities, we''ll formulate proposals to improve their impact on and relationships with these communities and institutions, based on our assessment and their own engagement to this research project.', 'Case selection (everyone)\nSearch for candidate spaces and select 4 that fit the following criteria:\n    a. is active\n    b. has an online digital record of discussions and activities longer than 2 years\n    c. has known cases of contributions to better perspectives and opportunities for participants and connected communities\n    d. geographical diversity\n    e. is open to collaborate with our research\nThe most significant part of this step will be the interaction with these communities in order to establish tacit agreements to collaborate in the development of this research, including procedures to open the data and how to store it privately in case of objections to opening up sensitive parts of interviews and private communications.\n\nData collection (Alexandre, Carmen)\nThis involves identifying the communication protocols used by each community, setting up databases and developing data scraping tools, cleaning up the data from spam and other unrelated content, structuring it properly for research. We''ll likely have to negotiate access to some content, and recruit the assistance of participants to complement the data available. In particular we''ll have to make sure data is properly timestamped so we can analyze the evolution of relationships which constitute these spaces.\n\nEthnography and surveying (an ethnographer, Alexandre)\nIn this step we''ll try to answer questions like the following ones, through the usual methods of observation, participation, interviews and questionnaires:\n    *What is the income distribution and education background of participants?\n    *How did they learn about these spaces and why do they go there?\n    *What opportunities do they understand they''ve achieved from participating?\n    *How do they feel about the role of these spaces in motivating them to pursue knowledge and improve their living conditions?\n    *How have they applied the knowledges and practices they learned in these spaces towards improving their livelihood?\n    *How has their participation affected their learning and research? Did participation drive them to pursue a more knowledge intensive career?\n    *What do participants see as important differences between these spaces and more formal knowledge environments?\nThe ethnographer, to be recruited once the project moves past a conceptual note, will follow the chosen communities virtually and, taking turns, visiting and participating in their daily affairs. If possible, in two cycles, enriching the picture by looking between them and across different moments.\n\nStatistical analysis and modeling (Alexandre, Carmen)\nWe will adopt a network analysis perspective, and characterize the topological properties of the evolving relationship networks formed by the participants of these spaces and their surroundings, including institutions and other communities, and interactions between these spaces themselves.\nWe intend to:\n    *provide visual representations which highlight topological similarities and disparities\n    *calculate the usual indexes of degree distribution and correlations, diameters and distances, clustering coefficients, among others that will let us identify properties such as ''small worldliness'' and freedom of scale.\n    *identify patterns and mechanisms for their growth and evolution, comparing our data to models from the literature, like random and preferential attachment networks, and designing more appropriate specialized models, accounting for features informed by ethnography.\n    *with additional input from the communities, develop metrics for the health and maturity of their relationship networks.\nComputational resources for data mining and processing will be provided by USP. We''ll employ Free Software only, most likely Gephi for network visualization and Graph-tool for analysis.\n\nCritical analysis (Alexandre, Sarita)\nWe shall compare our results to both the intuitive self-evaluation these communities make of themselves, and to current science and development policy, inquiring issues relevant to their growth and impact, as:\n    *Do their development outcomes justify public investment in these kind of activities, and how?\n    *What kinds and patterns of relationships emerge there, how does that support the diffusion and creation of knowledge?\n    *If these patterns play a role in promoting development, how can our understanding of them inform current practices in academia?\n    *What needs do these communities have that hurt their scalability and ability to improve lives?\n    *How can academia contribute by supplying resources, developing tools, or otherwise responding to these needs?\n    *Which  aspects of motivations are homogeneous across participants, which are  not, and how is that diversity important?\n    *How can citizens, governments and organizations, through action and policy, leverage the development potential of these spaces without clashing with these motivations?', 'We expect to characterize the growth of community based knowledge production spaces and how they impact local development.

If that happens, they could not only help validate our results, but even scale the project into more ambitious depths or to other spaces that our research team will not be able to reach.\nFinally, in addition to the ongoing possibility for criticism and participation, we will evaluate the impact of our research in terms of its repercussion among these groups, gathering feedback about the adequacy of our methods and usefullness of our outputs through surveys directed at both the citizen and academic communities.', '79,331.45 CAD, to be supplemented by local grants ', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/IBICT_Aknowledgement1.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudgetTemplate-Abdo1.xlsx', 162, 254, 'complete', 'yes', 1411169797, 'complete', 'Very exciting proposal.

(99, 'The principle researcher Dr. Rasika Dayarathna is involved in reputeU (http://reputeu.tk/) project. The aim of this project is to facilitate individuals to get rating of their virtues from their communities. Furthermore, the system presents stories that guide individuals to develop their virtues. One f the tasks in this project is to collect virtuous stories that have potential to inspire and guide others to follow. The experience gained from this project would help to conduct the proposed project.\nIt is expected to analyze the collected data from participants to generate hypotheses. Various techniques have to be used in analyzing data and generating hypothesis. The principles in Grounded Theory are very useful in this regard. The experience gained by applying GT based study during the PhD studies of the the principle researcher would help apply GT theory based approach in generating hypothesis.\nOne of the highly concerned aspects of this project is privacy issues of the participants. Participant would be reluctant to share their practices unless they are satisfied with the protection given to their personal information. Therefore, the privacy issues have to be taken seriously. The principle researcher did his PhD in Information Privacy. Therefore, it is possible to take adequate measures to protect personal information.\nAnother concerned are is legal issues. The main legal issues is taking measures to prevent individuals from getting self-prescription from the ''knowledge hub'' which is not designed provide information to subscribers. Therefore, it is the responsibility of researchers to give strong disclaimer and to obtain the consent of the user at the registration stage. These issues can be handled by the principle researcher since he is also an Attorney-at-Law in Sri Lanka.\nMr. Isuru Balasooriya who is another research collaborator has previously worked with a research and development of a learning object repository for Sri Lanka in development and team leading capacity. He has also worked with end users to capture requirements and usability tests for user interface design. His experience in systems design and development will be channeled towards the project implementation.\nAdditionally, two researchers from Monash and Melbourne University would share their experience in designing the "Knowledge Hub" and deriving the hypothesis. This would provide good opportunity for Sri Lankan researchers to work with more experienced researchers in this domain and Australian research experience in similar projects. This would complement the research skills of the Sri Lankan researchers.\nDr. Arnold works in the intersection of technology and society. One of his research areas is medical informatics where he investigates how people interact with health related systems. Dr. Arnold was awarded several research grants by Australian Research Council.\nDr. Tom Denison is a Research Associate with the Centre for Organizational and Social Informatics (COSI) in the Faculty of Information Technology at Monash University. He conducts research within the fields of social and community informatics, specializing in research relating to the effective use of information and communications technologies (ICTs) by communities and their members. His research areas include effective use of ICTs by non-profit organizations and cultural institutions and role of social networks.', 'A Collaborative platform for collecting indigenous health knowledge and practices for scientific verification', 'Sri Lanka', 'Indigenous or folk medicine is considered by many as an alternative medicine and it includes natural herbal medication, practices and food types that facilitates a healthy lifestyle. Much of this knowledge is distributed in the experience of the general public and the indigenous medical practitioners. \nIn the local context, Sri Lanka has a Ministry of Indigenous Medicine as well as a university institute for indigenous medicine studies . There are currently 62 Hospitals and 208 central dispensaries and approximately 20,000 registered practitioners of indigenous medicine.\nIn indigenous medical practices, the different factors involved in constituting an individual’s health make clinical experiments and diagnosis harder. Since the complexity of the process and the time taken, the present research methods (applied in western medicine) is not suitable and as of yet very little has been done to corroborate the indigenous system with scientific research especially in a setting like Sri Lanka where both are highly used.\nOur aims is to bring together popular knowledge in a way that facilitates a consolidation of that knowledge and its proper interpretation and use as a basis for further development, which is extremely difficult if it remains in isolated pockets. The project intends to address this through an ICT based “knowledge hub” to gather or to motivate the public who are in possession of traditional knowledge by inheritance or experience, where we facilitate data collection and creation of knowledge related to the indigenous health science and food culture. What we aim to provide is a platform where data from the public can be collected and once the data is collected, it can be analyzed to identify possible hypotheses. Once these hypothesis are generated, they can be presented to medical practitioners to let them test again in different settings with a control over the number of factors associated.', 'Proposed solution:\nThe main deliverable of the project is the “ICT based knowledge hub” where the data from the target audience is captured. We propose an ICT based system which can be accessed online (via Web and mobile), and capture the range of data that is required. The range of data indicated here are the information regarding habits and the lifestyle of a particular individual.\nThe project goals match closely with those of OCSDNet ideals, where our research project is designed to address gaps of knowledge through multi-level data collection and theory building process.\nThe data collection and the types of data are to be collected:\nThe instruments of data collection can be forums, discussion boards, Question posting, commenting, article publishing, surveys (Water consumption, daily sugar intake, weather conditions etc) and polls. This collection of data needs to be mined to create working hypotheses on different diseases, foods or treatments or combinations thereof. \nWe will also use other citizen-science projects as examples of data collection techniques and incorporating them as field tested methods. \nPrivacy:\nIt is not the intention of the proposed solution to act as a personal health guide. Therefore we publish a disclaimer where we emphasize that the system contains a collected knowledge on indigenous health practices and any misuse of the knowledge contained is strictly not advised. Also, since the data gathered is not \nUser-friendliness or seamlessness in gathering data:\nTo this end, the system must be built to cater large amounts of data, to conform to multi-platform support as well as user-friendliness to attract users. Types of diseases, foods, remedies etc. must be categorized where new knowledge can be appended to the existing body. Patterns should be easily followed through searchability or indexing within the content.\nUser interfaces and data presentation:\nInformation should be easily generated and displayed separately within the system for overall analysis. Categorization can easily filter desired keywords and work as tags throughout the system. Information pertaining to a topic can be tagged as the information is fed to the system. (i.e.: an article on high blood pressure and an indigenous herbal treatment for lowering high blood pressure can both be tagged under high blood pressure. They can be easily located afterwards under the tag)\nData mining and hypothesis generation:\nAfter categorization and coding the information, we are focused on a manual approach for the hypotheses generation. For example the gathered information on Diabetes may show similarities across individuals, repeated practices etc. Such information can be the base of the hypothesis outcome. Other minor factors should also be identified and included as partial factors.\nSustainability:\nOverall the project activity is based on the collection of data from many distributed sources and people with indigenous health knowledge. We aim for the sustainability of the system through end user interaction and a developing need for a centralized body of folk medicine discussion. Since we invite the collaboration of the authorities on indigenous medicine in Sri Lanka, the ministry as well as the university institute of Indigenous medicine of university of Colombo, we aim to engage the users with more motivation as well as a sense of validity.  However as noted earlier, the major output of this knowledge creation is to enable the scientific research into a yet obscure indigenous practices. We also aim for the sustainability through foundations who find the research hypotheses rewarding, since the information they obtain through this system is not readily available elsewhere. However we will not partake in advertising of health practitioners/medicine or the marketing of personal information towards sustainability.\nImplementation partners:\nThe project will be a collaboration between University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC), Sri Lanka, Monash University, Australia and University of Melbourne, Australia. UCSC will undertake the development activities under the collaboration and supervision of all partner universities.', 'What we gather is a volume of distributed knowledge on indigenous medicine and health practices, therefore as an output we will have a centralized information system where cross referencing and identifying contradictions possible. The information will be valuable for hypothesis generation, and thereby be available for researchers for laboratory testing.  The knowledge will therefore be open and collaborative for the use of scientific research.\nWith this information in a format where accessibility is high, and categorization, filtering and other mining techniques can be applied; they can be readily distributed to interested parties. Through the collected information, public awareness of indigenous health practices can increase as well.\nAs our primary goal, the input for scientific research can increase with the hypothesis generation. This can lead for the validation of long held folk medicine practices, identifying potentially dangerous drugs and the promotion of healthy food types among the population.', 'We require the collection of data and information to be as complete as possible for the system outputs to have quality and quantity. We choose to adopt evaluation criteria such as user participation statistics, the hypotheses generation statistics and the amount of laboratory tests that were proven positive etc.\nTowards user participation we intend to build awareness through the local authorities and social media about the program, which would influence local population to contribute. For the individuals without the technical capacity to contribute, we plan on conducting data gathering workshops and train regional correspondents who can continue the information flow. We intend this process to achieve sustainability as the indigenous health practices are widely used and discussed.\nOur vision of progress is the amount of scientific contribution. Therefore the scientific community plays a major role in establishing that vision. However at a knowledge creation level, our evaluation of progress comes at the amount of hypotheses generated and the richness of user participation', '70,504 CAD', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/Endorsement_Letter1.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudget3.xls', 164, NULL, 'complete', 'yes', 1410236161, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, 'yes');

However, in terms of science and technology (S&amp;T) research outputs, the Caribbean lags behind other regions. A major problem is the limited investment in science and technology research within the Caribbean relative to other developing countries. Many observers have therefore promoted regional and international research cooperation as a way of improving these outputs. Recent data suggest that research collaboration in the Caribbean appears to be more common among the smaller territories and where it does exist it is primarily internationally focused (EUCARINET, 2012).</p><p>Of concern then is how to improve both regional and international research collaboration in the region. An emerging set of approaches to research can be termed open and collaborative science (OCS). This includes increased greater collaboration and sharing at various stages of the research process. Given the relevance of these approaches to research, the main question that this project proposes is:</p><p>(1) Can open and collaborative science contribute to greater international and regional research collaboration in the English-speaking Caribbean?</p><p>The main objective of this proposal is to understand the implications of OCS for research collaboration from the point of view of the researcher. While it maybe that the OCSDN has a normative agenda in issuing this call for concept notes (i.e., to explore and promote the potential OCS), we in the Caribbean need to understand its implications for our own development. Indeed, this is in keeping with a similar and long tradition of the Caribbean social sciences to interrogate new and emerging concepts in the region. Understanding how OCS can potentially improve research collaboration in the Caribbean is significant for two reasons.</p><p>First, both regional and international collaboration between scientists is important in the science and technology disciplines where research often requires large amounts of human, financial, and organizational resources.</p><p>Second, given the contexts of SIDS, regionalism is often promoted as a way of negotiating the negative repercussions of globalization. While state led regionalism in the Caribbean has fallen short of in several areas, non-state actors have been important and remain crucial to contemporary efforts to promote increased regional cooperation. In that regard, research collaboration among S&amp;T researchers in the Caribbean can also be significant in supporting greater regionalism. In order to address the overall research question we note that it is important to first understand patterns of S&amp;T research collaboration in the Caribbean.</p><p>A previous study (EUCARINET, 2012) conducted a bibliometric analysis of research outputs in the Caribbean but the focus was on publications levels and number of collaborations across countries. While this is important, we want to also understand the individual strategies and patterns of collaboration in the region, an issue that remains under-researched. Thus our first research sub-question is:</p><p>(1.1) What are the individual strategies and patterns of international and regional research collaboration in science and technology in the Caribbean?</p><p>Going further is the notion that OCS can lead to improved research outputs in the region. However, as noted above it is important to understand what this means for Caribbean researchers. Thus we need to appreciate the meanings that researchers ascribe to OCS and the motivations they have for engaging in this practice. Motivations can vary particularly when we are considering alternative approaches to knowledge production (see for example Thakur, 2011).</p><p>The second research sub-question we explore is: (1.2) What are the meanings that Caribbean researchers ascribe to OCS and why do they participate in this type of research?</p><p>Finally, we want to explore how these patterns and meanings vary across sub-disciplines and institutions within S&amp;T. Based on previous work, we argue that new approaches to knowledge production can have negative distributional outcomes for those who lack the necessary skills and knowledge to fully participate in these approaches; thus exacerbating existing inequalities (see for example Cozzens and Thakur, 2014). Our interest here is in existing inequalities between institutions and also across sub-disciplines. Thus we ask:</p><p>(1.3) Is OCS more beneficial for certain types of research institutions and sub-disciplines in Caribbean S&amp;T?</p><p>The three sub-questions help us to address the overall research question by for example, examining how the meanings S&amp;T researchers give to OCS intersect with their existing patterns of research collaboration and finally the related distributional outcomes across different types of institutions and sub-disciplines. This is in line with research themes as described in the Call for Concept Notes. More specifically this proposal falls under Themes 1 and 4.</p>', '<p>There are three main design components to this proposal that will help address the above research questions.</p><p>First, we will conduct a bibliometric assessment of research publications in the areas of science and technology in the Caribbean (we will define the sub-fields prior to the start of the project). We will utilize both the Web of Science and Scopus databases; where possible we will employ Google Scholar as well. This combination allows for a potentially more comprehensive data set. Our focus is on the countries and territories in the English-speaking Caribbean. This is because research collaboration often depends on a common language between the researchers. Also, focusing on a specific group of countries in the region will make the project more feasible.</p><p>To further specify our research we will limit the bibliometric analysis to the period 2000 to the present. Given the limited number of research publications in the region, this period should be sufficient to capture publications from all territories. Furthermore, these publications will be sufficiently recent such that we can potentially interview collaborators. This analysis will yield various patterns in regional and international collaboration among Caribbean researchers. While we will be able to identify for example number of publications by individuals and countries, our focus is on networks of collaboration in particular fields. That is, we want to identify those researchers engaged in research collaboration both regionally and internationally. This will yield a sample of researchers which will inform the second component of our project.</p><p>Data from this analysis will be used to address sub-question 1.1. Based on this sample, our goal is to implement a large structured interview exercise. Given current academic staff numbers in the region and possible response rates, we could interview between 100 to 200 researchers throughout the Caribbean, over the course of a year. We will use a structured format to get standardized responses to questions on approaches to research collaboration and attitudes towards OCS. However, we will also use the interviews to engage in discussions about the potential efficacy of OCS at the individual level and across institutions.</p><p>This will include asking respondents about opinions on policies of open access publishing within academia, open access to data sets, intellectual property reform, and crowdsourcing data collection among others. All structured interviews will be done in person where feasible, via the telephone, or using the Internet (e.g., Skype). In addition, adequate measures will be taken during the interviews to ensure the participant&#39;s privacy and anonymity. The interview instrument will be developed with pilot tests. Data from these structured interviews will be used to address sub-questions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3.</p><p>The third research design component consists of a series of focus group sessions in four of the major (by population size) countries in the English-speaking Caribbean: Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Guyana. We will aim to conduct at least 2 focus groups discussions in each country with participants based on their sub-discipline, institutional affiliation, etc. Participants will be drawn from our interview sample. The focus groups will allow us to engage in dialogue with researchers about OCS and its implications for their work. More importantly, we will design a self-reflection exercise as part of the focus group format that asks participants to consider the assumptions they make about their own research designs and research collaborations and how these compare with an agreed upon understanding of OCS.</p><p>In this way, together we will assess our own epistemologies and the extent these are in keeping with our stated goals of serving the public. Also by delineating groups according to institution and discipline we will also be able to assess differences in the perceived benefits of OCS across groups. This third component will help us address sub-questions 1.2 and 1.3. The actual implementation of the study will be done by project staff within the Center for Leadership and Governance, UWI, Mona which includes a multidisciplinary team from across the social sciences.</p><p>Furthermore, the CLG has had significant experience in implementing similar research projects over the years. These include national household surveys, policy evaluations and social, economic and other impact assessments for various government and international organizations. We will be responsible for all aspects of design, implementation, and for generating outputs of the project. Throughout this process we will include inputs from colleagues in the OCSDN and elsewhere, while also making our outputs as publicly accessible as possible. After all, a study about OCS should itself practice open and collaborative research.</p>', '<p>There are five major research outputs that we expect from this project:</p><p>1. A Final Report that will outline the key findings of the project and will be made available in print and electronic format using a creative commons or similar license. It will be written using language accessible to non-technical audiences. This will also be distributed at the final project workshop as well as via the project website (see below).</p><p>2. Policy Brief. This will provide specific recommendations at the policy level for the administration and leadership of higher education institutions in the Caribbean and for governments. The brief will place an emphasis on relating the project findings to the higher level goals of improving S&amp;T research collaboration and specifically regional scientific collaboration in the Caribbean.</p><p>3. Quantitative and qualitative data sets. This will consist of the complete structured interview and focus group discussion data sets. All data will be completely anonymized and will be made available through the project website under an appropriate creative commons or similar license. The data will be published as soon as possible subject to the rules of the OCSDN project.</p><p>4. Project website. This will serve as a public information portal for the project which will also help to raise awareness about the OCS and research collaboration in the Caribbean. Content on the site (including all project outputs) will be linked to various social media networks to ensure broad publicity. This will be supported by the University of the West Indies&#39; own marketing machinery where possible.</p><p>5. Policy-dialogue Workshop. The project will culminate in a final workshop that will be used to broadcast and refine the outputs of the research and identify engagement in follow-up activities. Both the final report and the policy brief will be presented at the workshop.</p><p>All the above outputs contribute to the overall project objective of understanding the implications of OCS for research collaboration in the Caribbean. Outputs 4 and 5 in particular are related to broader expected outcomes of raising interest and awareness around the issue of OCS at the academic and policy levels. Indeed, by making (what we expect to be) a substantial data-set available from the project, we hope to encourage others to conduct further research on this topic.</p><p>Another and perhaps more ambitious expected outcome of this project is for the participants (S&amp;T researchers in the Caribbean) to become active in a continued discourse around the efficacy of OCS for the region. They would do so as part of the reflexive nature of the research design (e.g., the focus groups).</p>', '<p>We will create a project management committee which will monitor and evaluate progress with regard to each of the project outputs outlined above. This will draw on staff from within the Center for Leadership and Governance (CLG) and the Department of Government (UWI, Mona). The committee will be guided by a project schedule (to be developed) with projected dates for completion of each of the three research design components and five research outputs.</p><p>Overall project management will be supported by a project coordinator who will be hired specifically for this research project. We will also develop a logframe to support the monitoring and evaluation of the project. This will include metrics for evaluating outputs such as the time taken to completed specific outputs, the quality of data-sets made publics, the accessibility of all research outputs, website visits, and attendance at the final workshop among others.</p><p>In terms of the broader project&#39;s expected outcomes such as understanding the implications of OCS for research collaboration in the Caribbean, this can be assessed through the project&#39;s findings and final results. Ideally this would include whether or not the findings lead to any peer-reviewed publications (although this depends on the publication plans of the overall OCSDN project).</p><p>The other expected outcome (raising interest and awareness around the issue of OCS at the academic and policy levels) could be assessed through a series of short feedback surveys to be administered before and after each focus group session and also feedback at the final policy workshop. From a research point of view we could assess the level of external use of project related data-sets. Finally, in terms of getting researchers to join in a discourse around the efficacy of OCS for the region, one indicator could include independent discussions by others in academic forums, the media, or other relevant publications.</p>', '77,285', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/Endorsement_of_Research_Proposal__Dhanaraj_Thakur_and_Lloyd_Waller.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNetBudgetTemplate_-_OCS_and_Research_Collab_in_the_Carib.ods', 62, 254, 'complete', 'yes', 1411170366, 'complete', 'I find the proposal wanting as far as making more explicit the dilemmas between existing research collaborations and what is expected of OCS. There is, in my view, a difference between looking at it from the point of view of the researcher, and from the point of view of “our own development” (collective value and aspiration). One of the dilemmatic situations the project aims to tackle is how to overcome the common situation in which research collaboration is more common among the smaller territories, and where it does exist it is primarily internationally focused. The way the conceptual note is formulated reflects  perhaps an attitude of healthy scepticism as to the benefits and potentials of OCS.', '', 35, 'yes', 'yes'),

The OCS project objective to be achieved relates to Theme 1 (T1): Motivations (Incentives & Ideologies).\nAdoption of OCS in an open environment would require a strategic approach to remove barriers inhibiting open science collaboration. The proposed strategies are:\n? Establish transnational policy frameworks to promote and support the idea of OCS. Obstacles relating to licensing and copyright need to be addressed. Regional hubs should be created to improve accessibility to OCS;\n? Researchers should be educated on the advantages of OCS and the altruistic benefits of sharing research knowledge;\n? Government institutions have the footprint to disseminate information regarding OCS. These institutions already provide services to communities and have the organizational capacity to become future OCS hubs;\n? The hubs would be tasked to increase visibility and communication of OCS outside academic structures;\n? Governance and management of intellectual property should be amended to benefit the public good;\n? The hub should consult with copyright owners for access to intellectual property;\n? Measurement of the economic and social efficacy of OCS would be a hub function;\n? Initiatives relating to health equity and food sovereignty should be integrated to\nprovide a common framework for the Global South;\n\n?The development challenge of the project is encapsulated in a study undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which made the following findings in their report: “Review of Agricultural Policies, South Africa (2006) – Highlights and Policy Recommendations”:\n? Income distribution is among the most unequal in the world, and high levels of unemployment, poverty and HIV/Aids are major concerns;\n? The country has undergone immense social and economic change following the abolition of apartheid with fundamental reforms aimed at creating a more open and market-orientated economy;\n? An underlying principle for virtually all government policy is to bring the previously excluded black community into the mainstream economy through job creation and entrepreneurship;\n? Macroeconomic reforms have stabilized the economy, but serious problems of high unemployment and poverty remain;\nThe challenge which the Mamre CPA is faced with is to decide how the land should be commercially developed for sustainable agricultural production. The Council of Stakeholders representing the community are at the concept planning stage and lack the resources to engage agricultural consultants. Representation to government was made to assist with grant funding. The outcome is doubtful given the present budget constraints. This assignment will involve specialist consultants/collaborators who are knowledgeable and experienced in all the research areas (agricultural economics, soil, water and environmental practitioners, commodity enterprise developers and sociologists, etc.).\nThe Mamre community have succeeded in their land restitution claim and have been awarded approximately 2,000 hectares of farmland by the government. The village is located on the West Coast, about 60 km from Cape Town. There are approximately 6500 inhabitants who are also beneficiaries of the land claim. The land awarded to the community is currently being transferred to the Mamre Communal Property Association in terms of current South African laws. The transfer of ownership should restore land tenure security rights to the beneficiaries.\nMamre is a former mission station of the Moravian Missionary Society.\n? The Dutch East India Company first established a military and cattle outpost on the\nsite in 1701, known as De Kleine Post.\n? In 1808 Moravian missionaries established the Groenekloof mission station for Khoi\nsoldiers and their families after the Battle of Blaauwberg in 1806.\n? In 1838 emancipated slaves gravitated to the area as inhabitants.\n? In 1854 Groenekloof changed its name to Mamre.\n? In 1967 historic buildings were proclaimed as national monuments.\n\nThe descendants of the indigenous Khoi people of the Western Cape and former slaves, classified under apartheid as “Cape Coloureds”, still inhabit the village. Mamre is today listed as a heritage site and forms part of the “Moravian Heritage in the Western Cape”. Mamre is plagued by rampant unemployment, alcohol and drug abuse, teenage pregnancies, spousal and domestic violence and a host of other socio-economic related problems.', 'The research design will include a holistic and multi-disciplinary approach to address the key components of the detailed business plan and implementation strategies for the project. The focus areas to be addressed are listed below:\nAgricultural and applied economics\n? Agricultural information services\n- Database management;\n- Product flow;\n- Marketing information;\n- Strategic information (farm surveys);\n? Whole farm plans\n- Strategic operational planning models (linear and non-linear) to do viability studies and farm level strategic planning for producers in order to facilitate decision-making about crop selection;\n- State-of-the-art production technologies;\n- Financing options;\n- Marketing strategies;\n- Pricing and risk management;\n? Strategic planning\n- Agri-business assistance through comprehensive analyses and planning processes to identify new business goals and strategies for long-term growth and market success;\n- Customised, comprehensive strategic planning, facilitation, risk analysis and implementation services;\n? Business planning services\n- Comprehensive business planning services to meet the diverse needs of agribusiness firms and farming companies in increasingly complex market environments;\n- Assistance with clients’ business objectives and goals;\n- Design of short and long term strategies to achieve business success;\n- Start-up planning (to obtain appropriate funding);\n- Growth and expansion plans for established commercial as well as new emerging agri-businesses;\n? Research\n- Quantitative and qualitative market research, including surveys, in-depth\ninterviews, market overviews, sector overviews and focus group discussions;\n- Extensive research in water resource management and climate change;\n? Strategic market analysis\n- Market analysis throughout the entire agri-business value chain;\n- Combines field research, market analysis, client resource evaluation and strategic thinking to develop realistic and effective marketing plans;\n- Market studies and profiles, strategic marketing plans as well as commercial development strategies for alternative uses of traditional crops and livestock products;\n? Feasibility study and compilation of business plan\nOABS will follow a holistic approach when considering the feasibility of the project on farm, agribusiness or agro-processing level. Its multi-disciplinary project team has the capability to conduct comprehensive feasibility studies which include the technical, environmental, economic, financial and institutional aspects of a project, as well as to compile comprehensive business plans, based on the results of the feasibility studies in accordance with the needs and requirements of the various potential investors and clients.\n? Professional valuation services\nOABS’s current professional valuer, (Pine Pienaar) has 25 years’ experience in farm valuation for, inter alia, Absa Bank, the Land Claims Commissioner, the Department of Land Affairs and a host of agri-businesses and individual farmers. He was also responsible for the development of guidelines used by valuers in land claim cases, evaluation of the quality of valuations, as well as explaining the land claim valuations to the land owners.\nInstitutional and social services\nDevelopment Support Services to support the sustainable development of\npreviously disadvantaged farmers and farming communities with the emphasis on:\n- Strengthening of social capital;?\n- Institutional development;\n- Facilitation of capacity development of emerging farmers in order to create and\nmaintain sustainable and profitable businesses;\n- Operational analyses of emerging farmer activities to facilitate implementation of transparent, accountable and efficient management structures;\n- Information exchange;\n- Elevation of the depth of community participation;\n- Pro-active advice and information;\n- Project management & community development initiatives;\n- Collaborator’s value-added services:\no Facilitation and conflict management;\no Corporate social investment and community development; o Organizational development;\no SMME development;\no Environment and transformational processes;\nTechnical services\nThe main focus here is to provide a support service for the project, namely:\n- Basic assessments, scoping reports and full environmental impact assessments for feasibility studies as required prior to implementation of projects;\n- Soil and water quality;\n- Physical/biological adaptability of crops and livestock;\n- Technical aspects of crop and livestock production;\n- Marketing logistics;\n- Enterprise gross margin analysis;\n- Professional asset and business evaluation services;', 'The expected outcome of the proposed study include:\n? A detailed feasibility study viz. technical assessment, environmental assessment, economic viability, financial feasibility, social and institutional assessment.\n? A bankable business plan.\n? An implementation plan.\nAn integrated climate change modelling approach will be applied to optimize best crop combinations and cropping patterns under present and future climate scenarios. Empirically downscaled daily rainfall and minimum and maximum temperatures from an envelope of General Circulation Models (GCMs) will be applied in the modelling to determine the impact of projected climates on crop yield and quality and crop irrigation needs.\nThe proposed research builds on research undertaken according to the terms of reference published under a directed call for proposals, funded and managed by the Water Research Commission (WRC) and co-funded by Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) (WRC, 2010), i.e. “Adaptive Interventions in Agriculture to Reduce Vulnerability of Different Farming Systems to Climate Change in South Africa”, to be completed in 2015. This project was undertaken by the Climate Systems Analysis Group (CSAG) of University of Cape Town (UCT) as project leader together with University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) and OABS Development (Pty) Ltd and Stellenbosch University (Please find attached an article (discussing a specific case study) that was presented at the International Water Association (IWA) conference in Mexico City in May 2014).\nThe application of the methodologies and modelling techniques developed in the previous climate change research in itself support the open science approach and will benefit the community on a social and economic level. The previous research followed a case-study approach including four case study areas; two case studies in the winter rainfall area and two case studies in the summer rainfall area. The case studies focus on commercial farms. The application of research methodology for the Mamre community will benefit the beneficiaries and open science research results and methodologies to previously disadvantaged individuals.\nThe proposed research will create opportunities to further improve and refine the methodologies and models which could potentially assist in the roll out of the Comprehensive Rural Development Programme to other regions in the Western Cape Province and the rest of South Africa.\nThe involvement of the IDRC in our proposed research will assist to mobilize other role-players and actors to find best alternatives and solutions for the Mamre community. The cooperation between the various role-players align completely with the open science approach and will contribute at social, cultural and policy levels.\nThe proposed research is relevant and fit the OCSD thematic research areas: (a) Communities in practice of Open and Collaborative Science (OCS) in the Global South Context, and (b) Potential impacts (positive and negative) of Open and Collaborative Science (OCS). There are 12 sites identified in the province alone, for the implementation of the Comprehensive\nRural Development Programmes of the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform of the South African Government (DRDLR).\nThe proposed research extend across multiple thematic areas of Open and Collaborative Science (OCS), and is in the Global South and will include different organizations and organization types.', 'The proposed study includes an implementation plan which makes provision for monitoring and evaluation on a monthly basis. Monitoring and evaluation is important to evaluate performance and identify factors which contribute to delivery outcomes. The monitoring and evaluation programme should provide for users to easily draw casual correlations between choices made, the resourcing of objectives and programmes designed to implement them, the results actually obtained and the ultimate impact on the community.\nThe monitoring and evaluation programme helps to provide an evidence base for resource allocation decisions and helps identify how challenges should be addressed and successes replicated. Monitoring and evaluation is complex, multi-disciplinary and skill intensive and acquires detailed knowledge both across and within sectors and interactions between planning, budgeting and implementation.\nMonitoring involves collecting, analyzing and reporting data on inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes and impacts as well as external factors, in a way that supports effective management. Monitoring aims to provide managers, decision makers and other stakeholders with regular feedback on progress in implementation and results and early indicators of problems that need to be corrected. It usually reports on actual performance against what was planned or expected.\nEvaluation is a time-bound and periodic exercise that seeks to provide credible and useful information to answer specific questions to guide decision making by staff, managers and policy makers. Evaluations may access relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability. Impact evaluations examine whether underlying theories and assumptions were valid, what worked, what did not and why. Evaluation can also be used to extract cross- cutting lessons from operating unit experiences and determining the need for modifications to strategic results framework.\nMonitoring and evaluation should be based on supporting principles ensuring that monitoring and evaluation should: (a) contribute to improved governance, (b) rights based, (c) development orientated, (d) be undertaken ethically and with integrity, (e) utilization orientated, (f) methodologically sound, and (g) operationally effective.', '79,275', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/endorsments/OABS_Development_Letter_OCS_IDRC_2014-091.pdf', 'http://www.apply.ocsdnet.org/uploads/budgets/OCSDNet_proposal_budget_dd2014-09-081.xlsx', 184, NULL, 'complete', 'yes', 1410602963, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, 'yes');
